							Just over one hundred years ago Einstein, an alumnus of ETH, wrote down his final form for how matter interacts with spacetime. These equations of general relativity remain our best theory of gravity, successfully modelling behaviour on scales from centimetres to cosmological distances. <br>

							Einstein's theory assumes that space and time together form a 4d manifold. The spacetime metric measuring proper distance is the key quantity to solve for, and (very roughly) the principal part of the field equations can be thought of as a set of coupled wave equations, source by the mass-energy of the matter. <br>

							The interpretation as a wave equation leads to one of the most striking predictions of the theory is that information propagates no faster than light. This leads to predictions of gravitational waves. Like water waves these can be generated by some matter motion but then propagate large distances, carrying some information about the matter event that generated them.

							The first direct detection of gravitational waves came four years ago, almost exactly a century after Einstein wrote down his equations. Two years later, in August 2017, LIGO saw the first (and, to date, only officially confirmed) detection of a merger of two neutron stars. This is the first chance using gravitational waves to probe the full Einstein Equations, coupling matter to gravity (as black holes are modelled as vacuum solutions). <br>

							Here we see the neutron stars spiral in as gravitational waves remove energy from the system. They're disrupted just before they merge, when their relative angular velocities are roughly half the speed of light, leading to a hot, messy remnant that here rapidly collapses to a black hole. However, a lot of matter is left outside the black hole, and soon it will collapse inwards. When it interacts with the central magnetic field, wound up to high strengths by dynamo effects, much of the matter will be launched outwards in a jet. This produces strong emission in all EM bands and neutrinos, in addition to the gravitational waves.

							 Again, this was really close (in astrophysical terms). The masses involved are much smaller - each neutron star is only a little heavier than our sun, whilst the black holes involved in the mergers we've seen are at least ten times heavier. However, the signal from the neutron stars is detected for much longer, so it's the most powerful signal we've seen. In addition to giving information on the masses and spins we can also estimate the radii and get some information about the equation of state. From just the gravitational waves this tells us very little right now, but even this very limited information is constraining the behaviour of matter at extreme densities.

							But the luckiest thing about GW170817 is that is was detected across the electromagnetic spectrum. In fact, the very first alert came from a gamma-ray observatory. Gravitational waves then helped narrow down where to look. Over the following days (which for some poor teams stretched to months) the event was observed in every band (except, unfortunately, neutrinos). Essentially, the neutron stars crashed together, the central part collapsed to a black hole, and some of the remaining material was accelerated to near-light speed leading to huge amounts of emitted radiation. The EM signals constrain this process, giving us information complementary to the gravitational wave signal.

							This is an example of multimessenger astronomy: using complementary signals to get astrophysical information. This is also where modelling becomes every more crucial. We need fully quantitivative models of general relativity coupled to matter, throughout the merger, including as much physics as possible. This relies on numerical simulation, and is the focus of what comes next.

						Neutron stars are an astrophysical laboratory probing strong field gravity and the behaviour of matter at high densities. To get useful constraints we combine the gravitational wave detections (which currently only give information about the inspiral) with EM observations (which only give information about what happens post merger). <br>

						Each neutron star is really massive - at least as massive as our sun. However, they're really compact, with a radius of 10-15km. Put a neutron star centred on this room, and the surface wouldn't reach halfway into Lake Zurich. The magnetic fields typically start ten orders of magnitude larger than that of the sun, and can be wound up orders of magnitude more by dynamo effects in the merger. <br>

						From this we can determine the key numbers for numerical simulations. For GW170817 that the GW frequencies run from tens to thousands of Hz. If we focus on the last fractions of a second, where the frequencies are in the hundreds of Hz and which are all we can practially simulate, then that corresponds to a gravitational wavelength of order $10^6$ m. To get enough GWs into our grid to measure we'll need multiple wavelengths, so a grid boundary at order $10^7$ m. That's roughly the size of the Earth.
						<br>

						Similarly, we know that the NS radius is of order $10^4$ m. We'll need many tens of points across the radius to accurately capture the behaviour over the timescale of the merger, leading to a grid spacing of order $100$ m. The best current simulations have grid spacings on the order of $10$ m. So a single grid cell is a few times the size of this room: tiny compared to the Earth, but substantial for a single fluid element. Causality leads to the stability constraint (CFL!) meaning the timestep can't be bigger than $10^{-6}$ s. Computational resources restrict simulations to cover tens of ms at most.

							Numerical simulations of neutron stars need to solve for the spacetime. Whilst there are ten Einstein equations, they are written in a coordinate free form that isn't suitable for numerical evolution. First we must choose coordinates through gauge conditions. We can pick coordinates so that, as expected for something that's "like" the wave equation, the EFEs are well posed. However, the simplest ways of writing Einstein's equations lead to weakly hyperbolic systems of PDEs of no obvious type. After considerable work the field has come up with a range of ways of re-writing the system, leading to strongly or symmetric hyperbolic PDEs, although not all formulations are first order in space. After including gauge conditions we typically have to solve 20-30 equations of motion for the spacetime, and take care of additional auxilliary constraints arising from the definition of new variables.

							The matter source is minimally coupled to the spacetime. This is a great advantage: when solving for the spacetime the matter comes in as an algebraic source term, and when solving for the matter it's on an instantaneously given spacetime background. The equations of motion of relativistic matter can be illustrated using a compressible ideal fluid. Start with the continuity and Euler equations in Newtonian, without gravity, in conservation form. These should be standard. <br>

							We then generalize to Special Relativity, where there's no gravity but matter can't move faster than light. We see the relativistic effects appear in two ways. First, terms are length contracted by this Lorentz factor: that's one at low speeds and diverges as the fluid velocity approaches that of light. Second, in the Euler equation we have to add in the energy content of the heat. This comes in through the specific enthalpy of the fluid. <br>

							This is already enough to show a number of the mathematical and practical features that appear in the fully general model. The system remains hyperbolic but signal speeds can't be faster than light. The different equations of motion are more tightly coupled than in the Newtonian case as all components of the velocity appear in the Lorentz factor. The combination of these effects tend to make relativistic fluid simulations more costly and less accurate than Newtonian counterparts. <br>

							Finally we look at the full GR hydro equations. The principal part is modified by the metric determinant, modifying how we measure length and time in a way that continuously varies. In addition, the choice of coordinates explicitly appears through the gauge variables. Finally, the non-local behaviour in the spacetime curvature appears in the gravitational source terms. Together these pose significant additional implementation issues - for example, it seems to be impossible to set up well-balanced schemes for these general equations - but few new conceptual issues.

							Current simulations can get down to resolutions around 10m. The elastic crust could be 1km thick, many of the non-ideal effects act on lengthscales of metres, and the superfluid regions of the star can extend for hundreds of metres. These all pose practical challenges.
							<br>
							The crucial mathematical problems come from the non-ideal and superfluid effects. Navier-Stokes style dissipation is acausal. There is no agreed "correct" non-ideal GR matter theory. We're looking for a first-order theory that's causal and thermodynamically stable. For the superfluids the problem is more practical. We have an agreed theory, but the equations of motion are not in conservative form. To evolve through merger, where strong shocks will occur, leads us back to non-conservative products, path-consistent schemes, and hence to dissipation again.

						<aside class="notes">
							For simulating the crust we need the equations of motion for elastic matter (more realistic plastic flow probably not needed for mergers, and is conceptually hard to formulate). It's determined by the stress-energy tensor which looks like that of a perfect fluid plus an anisotropic pressure term. However, the equation of state depends on the strain, and measuring that requires comparing the matter configuration to its "relaxed" state in a covariant way. <br>

							To do this we have to compare the current state of matter to where it came from. This involves mapping from our spacetime 3-slice to a "reference" 3-manifold with its own metric. This is standard in Newtonian theory as well, but there the coordinate simplifications mean the maps, metrics and volume elements can be implicit. In the GR formulation we've had to evolve these all explicitly, leading to a larger state vector and additional computational costs. <br>

							For smooth solution Carter, Schmidt and others have shown this approach is well-posed. For our specific formulation and sensible EOSs we have that it's symmetric hyperbolic and can be written in conservation law form. However, there are auxilliary constraints from the definition of the maps between the manifolds, and comparable Newtonian formulations show that these should be added to the system to ensure numerical accuracy. These add non-conservative products, which complicate the analysis: in practical cases we've solved this naively without problems.

							Can couple the crust to fluids as shown here. The computational cost of these simulations is large, compared to (M)HD. Evolving the maps is part of it - the state vector is twice the size. There are also constraints, as in MHD, but those seem to have little impact. The main issue is the conversion from conserved to primitive variables that requires a four dimensional root-find, which is both expensive and fragile. <br>

							These shattering simulations rely on a level set approach to couple the elastic solid to the fluid. This uses Riemann-problem based boundary conditions at the matching layer between the materials, guaranteeing continuity of traction. A large part of our work has been checking when these approaches work in relativity, which seems to be in most cases (but not well when trying to match to the vacuum outside the NS).

							Almost exactly a century after Einstein wrote down his theory, gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time. The LIGO team detected the merger of two black holes, which emitted more energy in gravitational waves than is contained in our solar system. The detectors work by measuring distances between mirrors, as the gravitational wave will change these in different directions. Despite the incredible energies involved, the distance change was tiny - 1e-18 metres. From the signal we can estimate the masses and spins of the black holes, giving us information about how they formed. <br>

							Now, the first detection involved some luck: it was really loud (as it was quite close), and it happened just before the detectors were officially due to start taking data. Since then about a dozen weaker black hole mergers have been officially detected (and there's lots more candidates in the latest observing run, but more analysis is needed for confirmation). However, the really lucky event happened in 2017.

							GW170817 is the only fully confirmed and checked GW signal of a BNS merger. In a staggering stroke of luck only seen when thousands collaborate over decades, the strongest GW signal yet detected was the (relatively) close merger of two neutron stars, giving us strong field information about their interior physics.
							<br>
							A crucial point to note here is that LIGO has observed the merger from about 50 up to 500 Hz: in principle we expect the signal to span from tens to a few thousands of Hz.

							Multi messenger is going to be the key approach until third generation detectors come online. Using complementary observation channels we can get further information to constrain the microscopic properties. This isn't new: neutrino and EM observations have been combined for studies of the sun, and for supernovae. By including GWs we're getting constraints on the coupling between gravity and matter. It's hard to do: localising the source just from GWs is tricky with so few detectors, especially fast enough (even with GW170817 the first trigger was in $\gamma$!), but improving the network will help (eg, LIGO India).
							<br>
							For GW170817 there's a wealth of information about the post-merger regime, particularly the jet pushed out by the kilonova and the products left over. This gives some weak constraints on the constituents of the progenitor NSs. These constraints will be strengthened by further observations in O3 and beyond: was Sunday's event (1st September) another BNS merger?
