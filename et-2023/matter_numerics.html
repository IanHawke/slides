							The ETK was designed with gravitational wave applications in mind. That means the motivating examples for including matter are astrophysical, in particular neutron star mergers. This should not be taken as representative of all research on relativistic numerical simulations with matter. There's a lot of work done in, for example, alternative theories of gravity with high energy physics applications where scalar fields are crucial, and cosmological applications where "dust" or radiation fluids are essential. However, for our motivating example of neutron star mergers that the ETK has been set up to support, we're looking at relativistic magneto-fluids at finite temperature, coupled to radiation transport.

							We now know the outlines of our problem. We want a model of matter, coupled to GR, that we can write as a set of PDEs. This model will encode the detailed physics we're interested in, at the level we can simulate with our given resources. But before we try and be specific, let's look at what we can say in general.
							<br>
							We know the field equations require total stress energy conservation: the divergence of $T^{ab}$ is zero. We can use this to get <i>four</i> equations of motion. The most useful form for our purposes is to use the standard identity for the 4-divergence of a vector, which can be written as the <i>partial</i> 4-divergence of that vector, weighted by the metric determinant. To get from the stress-energy, which is a two-tensor, to a vector, we contract the free index with one member of a <i>tetrad</i>, which is a set of orthonormal (in our case) vectors that we can link to the coordinates. This then allows us to write stress energy conservation as four PDEs, one for each member of the tetrad.
							<br>
							The key point is that the only derivatives of the matter appear in total divergence form. The term on the right-hand-side which isn't in this form only involves derivatives of the tetrad, which can be written as derivatives of spacetime quantities. We write this abstractly in <i>balance law form</i>: all derivatives of the matter are total derivatives, but these <i>fluxes</i> must balance off against the <i>source terms</i> which come from the geometry.
							<br>
							If we simplify to Minkowski space in standard Cartesian coordinates then the source terms vanish and these balance laws reduce to the <i>conservation laws</i> for energy-momentum. However, we need to be careful of this interpretation (locally): if we write Minkowski spacetime in <i>spherical</i> coordinates then there will be source terms, but that certainly does not mean that energy-momentum is being transferred between the matter and the spacetime.

							We see that <i>generically</i> the matter will obey conservation laws. We expect the fluxes ${\bf f}$ to depend <i>nonlinearly</i> on the conserved variables ${\bf q}$. This immediately tells us something very important.
							<br>
							The simplest conservation law is the advection equation, where the solution is propagated to the right with constant speed $v$. For a nonlinear conservation law we can <i>locally</i> approximate it as an advection-like equation, where the solution propagates with speed $\partial_q f$. This means the propagation speed depends on the data. Depending on the form of the flux function, some gradients will steadily get steeper, and some will get shallower. In the absence of dissipation (and crucially the generic total energy-momentum equations have no dissipative terms) these steepening effects will lead to discontinuities: a generic <i>shock</i> will form.

								$$
								<p>
									Finding the flux $f_{k \pm 1/2}$ depends on the model (for fluids see <a href="https://einsteintoolkit.org/thornguide/EinsteinEvolve/GRHydro/documentation.html"><code>GRHydro</code></a> etc).

							All the previous discussion has focused on linear models such as the wave and advection equations. However, matter models such as fluids naturally lead to nonlinear balance laws. The nonlinearity means that information is propagated at a speed that depends on the data, meaning that generic initial data will lead to discontinuities forming. At this point the strong form of the PDE does not make sense. Instead we need to use the weak form which follows from the finite volume representation shown earlier, where we integrate the PDE over the cell volume.
							<br>
							We saw earlier that it's essential to reconstruct the data using a data-dependent method such as a WENO scheme. When applied to the weak form we use this to compute the flux through the cell boundaries. This can be done in multiple ways. The first standard one is to compute a flux at the cell centre, reconstruct to the boundaries, and average appropriately. The other standard approach is to reconstruct the fields to the boundaries and then solve the <em>Riemann Problem</em> to say how the fields evolve when jumping at the boundary, from which the flux is computed. The precise approach does not matter - the key is that the same cell boundary flux is used when updating neighbouring cells. This ensures conservation and is essential for a discontinuity to propagate at the right speed.

							Getting shock propagation speeds right is essential and depends both on how the model is written and how the numerical method implements it. A standard example is shown on the slide, where - if we were only dealing with differentiable solutions - the results should be identical for all values of n. However, as soon as a discontinuity forms, its speed depends strongly on the value of n. This means that manipulating a balance law for numerical advantage has to be done with care, as both the model and the numerics need to be consistent.
							<br>
							This links to other quantities or concepts that should be constrained or bounded. As we've seen, in MHD the divergence constraints are also crucial in order to get good numerical results. Other examples would be the second law of thermodynamics, or the constraints resulting from the 3+1 split. However, conservation constraints are probably the most extreme, and must be enforced at the discrete level.
							<br>
							For more complex matter models it is possible to have shocks even when the model has equations not in conservation law form. In this case we need to look for entropy functions which are non-increasing and change only at shocks, and which encode the underlying dissipation of the model. It is then possible to construct <em>path consistent</em> schemes. This is often linked to methods that ensure that energy functions are conserved discretely, which are implemented within the <code>SummationByParts</code> thorn of the ETK.

							The classic algorithm used by Einstein Toolkit codes works as follows.
							<br>
							The weak solution is stored as an integral average over the grid cells. Using the weak form we write the update in terms of the flux through the boundary of the cell. In one dimension that's the flux contributions into the cell from the left and out through the right.
							<br>
							We then take these integral average solutions and reconstruct a pointwise function interpolating the data. This has to ensure conservation of the data, or shocks are inconsistent. It has to allow for discontinuities: all practical methods put discontinuities at the cell boundaries. So generically we assume that the data is always discontinuous at cell boundaries.
							<br>
							We then need to solve this discontinuous problem at the boundary to compute the flux. This is usually called the <em>Riemann Problem</em>. Strictly the Riemann Problem finds the solution for all variables, and we then construct the flux from them (using self-similarity). However, we can (and often do) use approximations that give the flux directly from the variables.
							<br>
							We can then update the discrete integral averages using the flux contributions. This is often talked about as updating the reconstructed solution which is then integral averaged back onto the discrete cells.
							<br>
							Adding sources can be done algebraically. Provided they change slowly in time, which is true for the geometric terms, this is fine. To evolve in time we use the standard method of lines approach. Both absolute and order of accuracy are dominated by the reconstruction method, with some impact from the time evolution. The Riemann solver has an impact near shocks and ensures stability.

							So, why don't we all use spectral methods? Well, they have major disadvantages. Here we'll mention two. The first is when the fields lose differentiability. This occurs naturally with matter models, particularly fluids.
							<br>
							This is why we think about the methods in terms of interpolating functions or polynomials. The standard Gibbs' effect is usually introduced in terms of Fourier series but can be seen in other function basis representations. That is, when a finite amount of data is used to represent a discontinuous jump in a field, the truncated series approximation will oscillate near that jump. When we differentiate the approximation in order to approximate the derivative of the original field, those oscillations are amplified. As Gibbs' oscillations do not converge with amplitude as the order of the truncation is increased, this means the oscillations in the approximate derivative get worse as more computational effort is used.
							<br>
							For finite difference methods these oscillations exist but are confined to a region near the jumps. As spectral methods rely on a dense differentiation matrix, the oscillations induced contaminate the entire domain.
							<br>
							The alternative that avoids, or at least minimises, the oscillations, is to change the data used in the interpolating polynomial to avoid the jump. This ensures that Gibbs' oscillations are never introduced, so the derivative is fine. However, it means that the reconstruction step now depends on the data itself. There are many ways of doing this, from second order slope limited methods to high order WENO methods. Whilst they are essential for discontinuous data they are much more costly - in some cases an order of magnitude or more - than finite differencing.
							<br>
							These sort of reconstruction methods can be found in a number of thorns in the ETK. If developing your own code then for initial tests I would recommend taking the slope limited methods from, for example, <code>GRHydro</code>, but higher order methods will be essential eventually. For those I would recommend starting with the WENO methods which are most generically implemented in <code>WhiskyTHC</code>.
