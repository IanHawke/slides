							Let's briefly discuss the anatomy of a neutron star merger, and why we need numerical simulations. A neutron star binary, formed by some evolutionary track, is a pair of roughly solar-mass amounts of dense matter squeezed into a radius of around 10km. The orbit circularises and loses energy through gravitational wave emission, so the stars inspiral, and the inspiral accelerates, increasing the gravitational wave frequency in a predictable fashion. It's this inspiral that LVK observes.
							<br>
							When the stars merge the collision is violent and messy, increasing the core density, winding up the magnetic fields, heating up the matter through shocks and other interactions, shedding matter and possibly launching a jet, and triggering a range of nuclear reactions that lead to electromagnetic and neutrino emission. None of this can be captured approximately as yet: nonlinear simulations of anything past the last dozen orbits of inspiral are essential. LVK cannot yet observe post-merger gravitational waves, but next generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope will. The era of precision gravitational wave observation, mirroring precision cosmology, is hopefully 15-20 years away.
							<br>
							One of the fundamental applications of gravitational wave observations of neutron star mergers is understanding the state of matter in extreme situations: strong field gravity and high temperatures. Terrestrial accelerators and other experiments can give high temperatures. The inspiral phase and current LVK measurements can give at least bounds on the behaviour in strong field gravity. But only observations through the merger phase and the post-merger behaviour will give us the full picture of both strong gravity and high temperatures. When next generation detectors come online, they will need the templates derived from numerical simulations in order to extract the information about the microphysics. The key question is then, which physics needs including in the numerical model in order to get sufficiently accurate templates?

						<aside class="notes">
							We develop the key idea using a toy model.
							<br>
							Here we've taken the relativistic fluid equations and made a couple of key approximations. First, we've assumed we're working in coordinates moving along with the fluid flow. Second, we've assumed we're working on a small enough scale that the pressure and the expansion (which is the divergence of the velocity) are both roughly constant. There's plenty of cases where this doesn't work - turbulence wouldn't allow us to do this - but enough cases where it will to fix our ideas.
							<br>
							Next, we assume that the reactions are happening on a short timescale. Dimensionally we can pull this out into $\epsilon$, a small number encoding the ratio of scales. We will also linearize the reaction rate to make the steps clearer, although this isn't essential. Our key assumption is now that there is scale separation: behaviour at each power of $\epsilon$ is independent. Again, this wouldn't work in turbulent cases.
							<br>
							With these assumptions we can look for a power series solution in the species fraction. Plug this power series into the equation of motion for the species fraction and look at each power of the scale ratio separately. The leading order term in the power series is then fixed: remember $A, B$ are known functions that don't depend on the species fraction, as they come from linearising the reaction rate. We also see that this leading order term is in equilibrium: if it were the total species fraction and we plugged it into the equation of motion then its time derivative vanishes.
							<br>
							At zeroth order we have the next term in the expansion given by the time derivative of the equilibrium leading order term. Using the chain rule and the other equations of motion we can expand the time derivative. The precise form of the terms isn't essential here. What matters is that they are all evaluated at equilibrium, where the species fraction is given by the leading order term, which itself depends only on the baryon number and internal energy. We also pull out a factor of the expansion.
							<br>
							The reason for pulling out the expansion can be seen by going back to the other equations of motion, those for the baryon number and internal energy. The only place where the species fraction matters is in the pressure. We Taylor expand about equilibrium: the first order term is proportional to the first order term in the species fraction, so proportional to the expansion. That means it behaves exactly as expected for a bulk viscous pressure. The bulk viscous coefficient then depends on the baryon number and internal energy.
							<br>
							Putting this all together, what this multiscale calculation does is give us a reduced model. In the reduced model the species fraction is not evolved, but always assumed to be in equilibrium. Its value can be computed by setting the reaction rate to zero. The leading order impact of the out-of-equilibrium behaviour that should be there manifests itself as a bulk viscous pressure. The bulk viscous pressure coefficient can be evaluated using appropriate derivatives of the reaction rate, evaluated at equilibrium. We thus have to evaluate fewer equations of motion. More importantly, the problematic fast timescale has been removed from the problem, as the bulk viscous pressure correction term is linear in the small scale ratio, not inversely proportional to it as the reaction rate was.

							Let us now move from the toy model to looking at the impact for a real equation of state. Here we're using the APR4 equation of state, with the reaction rates and derivatives computed using the Fermi surface approximation. That's not ideal: unfortunately very few equations of state also have the reaction rates in a suitable form for this calculation in full.
							<br>
							This plot covers the range of densities and temperatures relevant for a neutron star merger. The core of the neutron star is typically at a few times nuclear saturation density (see note below). The outer layers of the neutron star are many orders of magnitude lower, but the Urca reactions are rapidly suppressed at low densities. The temperature of the neutron star during inspiral is low - it is expected to be well below 1MeV - but can reach around 100MeV through merger in extreme cases.
							<br>
							There are two key pieces of information in this plot. The first, given by the colour, is how big the bulk viscous pressure is compared to the total pressure. We see this can be substantial - certainly into the percent level - at low temperatures, and particularly through the core. The second piece of information is the timescale of the reactions. Remember, bulk viscous pressure is an approximation, and that approximation is only needed if the numerical timestep is too big. The lines pick a particular timestep. Every region below a line has reactions slow enough that the bulk viscous approximation isn't needed, and the full nonlinear reaction can be directly solved. The solid line is quite a poor numerical resolution by current standards. The top, dotted, line is an order of magnitude better than the best simulation ever run. We see that there's a region in parameter space where we will have no choice but to use a bulk viscous approximation.
							<br>
							Note: back of the envelope calculation says that nuclear saturation density, the unit we use for baryon density, is roughly equivalent to the density of the universe when $z \sim 10^{12}$, which is very early in the life of the universe. It's close to the neutrino decoupling time - unsurprising as the nuclear reactions are linked to those invoked for this, as is the temperature at that point of 1MeV. This was around 1 second after the Big Bang.

							Having argued that the nuclear reactions, in the bulk viscous approximation, can be relevant through merger, we actually want to test that. Doing the full nonlinear simulations is a real pain: for proper consistency we would need to keep track of the products of the reactions - that would be the neutrinos - by including radiation hydrodynamics, which increases the computational expense massively. Instead we focus on the extreme limits: the case where the reactions are infinitely slow and infinitely fast. If there's no way of distinguishing between these two cases observationally then we can leave this out of the model.
							<br>
							The simulations here again use the APR4 equation of state, and take two 1.4 solar mass neutron stars, initially 40km separated and in equilibrium, and run the simulation through a few orbits before merger. The three gravitational wave signals you see here are the slow and fast reaction limits, and then the slow reaction limit again but with a different numerical resolution to check that any differences are due to changing the model, not numerical error. By eye, it's impossible to tell the difference between the models.
							<br>
							However, we don't quantify signals by eye, nor do we do it in the time domain. Instead we look at signals in the frequency domain. So, perform the Fourier transform and look at where the power is in the signal. As the inspiral phase of the simulation will be the same - reactions only do anything at high enough densities and temperatures, so in the post-merger regime - we filter out the lower frequency inspiral signal to concentrate on the post-merger behaviour. This filtering was done in two different ways, and the result are unchanged by the choice.
							<br>
							The top panel compares the power spectra of the two models. The horizontal line is the design noise curve for the Einstein Telescope, giving us confidence that this post-merger signal would be detectable in ET. The peak in the power spectra of the post-merger signal has moved, as shown by the vertical dashed lines, by about 60Hz. This isn't a lot in a signal at 3kHz, but is orders of magnitude more than the phase change caused by changing numerical resolution, shown in the bottom panel. 
							<br>
							The question is then whether this makes a difference for estimating physical parameters in an observational pipeline. In particular, if we had a signal, and had the two templates for the different reaction limits, would we be able to distinguish which template was the better fit to the signal, given the noise? We can use the mismatch between the template signals to find the required signal-to-noise-ratio for distinguishability. The mismatch roughly finds the minimum difference, in frequency space, of two signals after phase and time shifting. The SNR required is then roughly the inverse square root of the mismatch. In our case the mismatch was 36%, so the SNR required is 1.2.
							<br>
							For a merger happening at a similar distance to GW170817, and using a next generation GW detector, we see that the signals are distinguishable.
							<br>
							I need to emphasise that this does not mean we could measure nuclear reaction parameters through GWs. We should instead think of this as being a potential systematic error in the signals. It's then necessary to include nuclear reactions correctly into numerical simulations to get sufficiently accurate templates for ET.

							When we set up the toy problem we never showed results to actually prove that the approximations made things better. Let's fix that here. None of the numbers mean anything much. The fast timescale here isn't too fast - typically one to four orders of magnitude less than the full run time, to see the effects.
							<br>
							In this case, where we're starting with the lepton fraction being at equilibrium, it's impossible by eye to distinguish the different cases.

							The power series expansion assumption isn't correct at early times. At that point the solution wants to relax exponentially quickly to (near) the equilibrium surface. We can see this by the plot. We can also see this by re-scaling the equation to look solely at the early time behaviour.
							<br>
							If we solve the re-scaled behaviour near the initial time, we can use matched asymptotic expansions to tell us how to correct the initial data for the reduced models. This is a pain, but re-captures all the advantages.
