    "<p>Excel, and spreadsheets in general, are a widely used and understood tool. Its strength is that nearly everyone has it available, and it is fast to do basic tasks with.  It's very useful for</p>\n",

    "<p>However, there are major issues with using spreadsheets. One weakness is that it is easy to make mistakes with spreadsheets and particularly with Excel. Amongst the many examples, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt\">Reinhart-Rogoff</a> paper on sovereign debt <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history\">accidentally excluded five rows</a> from a calculation of an average, which qualitatively changed their results. It has been claimed that political austerity measures were strongly motivated by this paper, which in part relies on a spreadsheet error.</p>\n",
    "<p>We need to talk about reliable methods for getting data into, and out of, spreadsheets. We also need to talk about data organization principles: how to make it easy for others to re-use your data. Finally, we need to look at the standard Excel mathematical functions for data analysis.</p>\n",
    "<p>One advantage of Python over Excel is that, as a full-featured programming language, it can be more easily used for long and complex tasks. The disadvantage is that many people may be interested in the results, but not interested in (or have the knowledge of) the programming details required to follow the Python code. To communicate the results whilst still showing those interested the full data, it's useful to <em>programmatically</em> take results from Python into a spreadsheet.</p>\n",
