    "<p>Constructing any mathematical algorithm is both an end in itself and a tool for future use. Being able to solve one linear programming problem using the Simplex method is good. Being able to solve any (suitable) linear programming problem using a function implementing the Simplex method allows us to ask more complicated questions. For example, how sensitive is the optimal solution to different constraints? This may be hard to answer analytically, but by calling our Simplex method function with slightly different inputs we can explore this question numerically.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, this <em>only</em> works if the function we are calling is robust. We know that Simplex \"fails\" on certain inputs (for example, when the problem is unbounded). If we accidentally pass in incorrect input (an unbounded problem, for example), or nonsense (the right inputs, but in the wrong order, for example), then we need our function to catch this error and inform us. If we don't, we might use nonsense output from the Simplex function as \"true\" results for our more complex questions.</p>\n",
