    "<p>We have discussed producing data (using algorithms in Python) and analysing data (using Excel). We now need to discuss mathematical communication: how do we explain our results to other professionals in a clear, robust, unambiguous fashion.</p>\n",
    "<section class=\"section2\"><h2>Script</h2>\n",
    "<section class=\"section3\"><h3>LaTeX</h3>\n",
    "<p>A mathematical calculation or argument needs to be <em>communicated</em>.\n",
    "Being able to do, or understand, the mathematics is not enough: you also need to be able to explain it to others.</p>\n",
    "<p>A central tenet of communicating a mathematical argument is that each step must be clear and supported with evidence.\n",
    "The evidence can come from many sources: a previous equation or theorem, a section of text, a figure, or table, or external source.\n",
    "To make a mathematical argument a sequence of steps must be given and clearly linked so that the reader can follow each step and see how it is supported.</p>\n",
    "<p>The purpose of LaTeX is to make it easier to produce a document containing a mathematical argument.\n",
    "In particular, it makes it easier to write equations and theorems, and to reference figures, tables and external sources.\n",
    "Its use is ubiquitous in scientific fields which use a lot of mathematics as it remains the best tool for making these sorts of arguments.</p>\n",
    "<p>LaTeX can be used more broadly to produce Powerpoint-like presentations, CVs, letters, and so on.\n",
    "This is not necessarily recommended: choose the right tool for your purposes.</p>\n",

    "<li>Open the <code>BasicLatex.tex</code> document.</li>\n",
    "<li>Compare the text between the <code>\\begin{document}</code> and <code>\\end{document}</code> to the <code>pdf</code> output.</li>\n",
    "<li>Look at whitespace.</li>\n",
    "<li>See how special commands start with a backslash</li>\n",
    "<li>See how <em>environments</em> form structures: the document, an itemized (or enumerated) list, equations, figures, and so on. These are indicated with the special <code>\\begin{...}</code> and <code>\\end{...}</code> commands.</li>\n",
    "<li>See how sections have their own special type of commands. Note the <code>\\label</code> command after the section command. This produces no output, but is essential for cross-referencing as we will see.</li>\n",

    "<section class=\"section4\"><h4>Exercise</h4>\n",

    "<p>As we've said, we want to make a mathematical argument.\n",

    "<li>Look at the labelled equation and the <code>\\ref</code> command.</li>\n",
