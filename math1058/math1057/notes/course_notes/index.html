<h2 id="a0000000004">1.1 Translating words into equations</h2>
<p>
Before we get started, it it important to understand what we are trying to achieve. This is generally good advice, and when it comes to mathematical modelling it is essential. Our understanding of reality is inevitably somewhat limited and we need to keep this in mind as we try to model what is going on. However, it may also be that our understanding is too precise and that we do not need all the details in order to describe a particular phenomenon. In essence, we have to make choices. 
</p>
<p>
The main purpose of applied mathematics is to make quantitative statements and predictions about the world that surrounds us. We achieve this by writing down and solving equations expressing relationships between quantities, such as distance, time, volume, money, density, value etc. This typically involves using <b class="bf">vectors</b> to describe the position of object in space and time (relative to some suitable frame of reference) and differential equations, expressing relationships between the <b class="bf">rates of change</b> of quantities with respect to others<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005">
<sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The ultimate aim of the process is to provide quantitative (or descriptive) predictions concerning “real world” situations. This is not a purely academic exercise. Without the study of these kinds of problems, life as we know it would not exist, your mobile phone would not work, you could not drive a car, planes would not fly, stock markets would be a lot poorer and people could not make predictions about climate and global warming. Non-mathematical models tend to be unable to make quantitative predictions that can be verified against experiments. Good mathematical models should be able to do this. 
</p>
<p>
In order to model something, it is important to be able to write down your assumptions and translate them into mathematical statements. Once you have a well-formed mathematical system you can begin to try solve the problem and make predictions. At this point it is fairly obvious that you need the mathematical problem to be simple enough that you can solve it<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006">
<sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a>, but at the same time the model must retain the key elements of the process we are trying to describe. At the end of the day, the result must be matched against observations and experiments. If our model provides a satisfactory description of reality, then we are done. If we need a more accurate model, then we need to go back and re-think our assumptions. You can think of this as an iterative process, outlined by the flow-chart in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figureMathModel">1.1</a>.

<p>
This may seem somewhat abstract, but it is easy to find examples of how our understanding has developed in just this way. Consider for example our understanding of moving objects. We can immediately think of two major paradigm shifts. First we have Aristotle’s notion that there can be no effect without a cause (essentially, there is no motion without a force), which gave way to Newton’s laws (where the role of the force is to alter the motion, or cause it in the first place). Secondly, as it became apparent that there was a contradiction between Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism in the late 1800s, developments were set in motion<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000007">
<sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> that led to the development of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Along the way, our understanding space and time changed. We moved from the fixed clockwork universe of Newton to the flexible space-time of Einstein. 
</p>
<p>
As we go on, we will consider these world views in some detail. We will start with Newton’s laws, mainly as a reminder but also in order to take the opportunity to revise (some of) the mathematical tools we need in order to solve relevant problems. 
</p>
</section><section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000008">1.2 Case study: Newton’s Laws of Motion</h2>
<p>
One of the first, and fundamental, applications of differential equations was to the laws of motion of objects, as written down by Newton in his <i class="it">Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica</i>, or <i class="it">Principia</i> for short, from 1687. The fundamentals of classical mechanics (as it is now called) were presented in precise and complete detail for the first time. They were based on experimental observations and written down in verbal form. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose we want to describe the motion of a single body. In order to do this, we need two definitions. First of all: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000009">
<li id="a0000000010"> <p>
the <b class="bf">mass</b> of a body <script type="math/tex">m</script> (measured in kilogrammes, kg) is a physical quantity associate with the body that acts to resist any change in motion of it<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000011">
<sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a>. Secondly, 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000012"> <p>
the <b class="bf">momentum</b> of the body (measured in kilogrammes per metre per second, kgms<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script>) is defined to be the mass times the rate of change of position of the body (relative to some point). A speeding bullet of low mass can have similar momentum to a slow moving but heavy truck. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With these two definitions, we can state the experimentally deduced laws of classical motion. These are Newton’s three laws: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000013">
<li id="a0000000014"> <p>
<b class="bf">N1</b>: A body remains at rest or in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame unless acted upon by a net force. <br/>
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000015"> <p>
<b class="bf">N2</b>: In an inertial frame a body acted upon by a net force moves in such a way that the rate of change with time of momentum equals the net force applied.<br/>
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000016"> <p>
<b class="bf">N3</b>: If two bodies exert net forces upon each other, these net forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. <br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, these statements introduce several additional concepts. First of all, we have the concept of a <b class="bf">force</b>. This is a derived quantity, in that its definition depends on that of momentum. The force is the amount of push or pull it takes to alter the motion of the body (measured in Newton, or kgms<script type="math/tex">^{-2}</script>). In essence, the first law (<b class="bf">N1</b>) defines what is meant by a zero net force, which in turn can be used to define an <em>inertial frame</em> as one on which no net force acts. The three laws are only valid in such inertial (non-accelerating) frames. Finally, the third law (<b class="bf">N3</b>), is not general. It holds only for particles in contact, or acted upon by forces parallel to the straight line connecting them. 
</p>
<p>
Newton originally used classical geometry to try to make predictions concerning the motion of bodies. However, the differential calculus of Newton/Leibnitz (developed at the same time) was quickly applied to the subject and this allowed a systematic approach to be developed, kick-starting a scientific revolution. 
</p>
</section><section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000017">1.3 Reminder: Scalars and vectors</h2>
<p>
Some quantities, like temperature (and pressure) are identified by their magnitude. These are called <b class="bf">scalar</b> quantities, and they are simply described by numbers: 
</p>
<div class="centered"> <b class="bf">scalar</b> = number (real or complex). </div>
<p>
 Other quantities, like wind velocity, are identified by both <b class="bf">magnitude</b> (size or length) <i class="it">and</i> <b class="bf">direction</b>. Such quantities are represented geometrically by arrows. 
</p>
<div class="centered"> <b class="bf">vector</b> = number (its size) <i class="it">and</i> direction. </div>
<p>
It is easy to think of examples of either kind of quantity: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000018">
<li id="a0000000019"> <p>
The position of one point relative to another in space is a vector. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000020"> <p>
The distance between the two points is a scalar. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000021"> <p>
The velocity of a particle in space is a vector. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000022"> <p>
The speed of a particle is a scalar. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000023"> <p>
The temperature of a body is a scalar. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As we will need to make a distinction<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000024">
<sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> we need to introduce suitable notation. There are a variety of ways to represent vectors. For example, the vector that joins point A with point B can be equivalently represented by indicated by <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}_{AB}</script>, <u class="underline">AB</u>, <script type="math/tex">\vec{AB}</script> or by a bold letter, <script type="math/tex">{\boldsymbol a}</script>, say. Throughout these notes we represent vectors by arrows, e.g. <script type="math/tex">\vec a</script>, as it is not practical to use bold symbols in calculations done by hand or on the blackboard. In most of the illustrations vectors are indicated by bold symbols. 
</p>
<p>
The magnitude (modulus) of a vector <script type="math/tex">\vec v</script> is is the length of the arrow and is denoted by the symbol <script type="math/tex">|{\vec v}|</script>. Vectors with unit length are called <b class="bf">unit vectors</b> and are often denoted by a hat. So for example, <script type="math/tex">\hat{{a}}\equiv {\vec a}/|{\vec a}|</script>. Two vectors are equal if they have the same length and the same direction. <br/>
</p>
<p>
A point in three dimensions can in general be reached by three non-coplanar vectors. One particularly important set of coordinates is the Cartesian. These coordinates can be represented by an orthonormal (the unit vectors are orthogonal) set of vectors called the <b class="bf">standard basis vectors</b> relative to an origin <script type="math/tex">\cal {O}</script> of coordinates. These basis vectors are: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000025">
<li id="a0000000026"> <p>
The unit vector from <script type="math/tex">\cal {O}</script> parallel to the <script type="math/tex">x</script> axis, denoted by <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ x</script> or <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script>; 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000027"> <p>
The unit vector from <script type="math/tex">\cal {O}</script> parallel to the <script type="math/tex">y</script> axis, denoted by <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ y</script> or <script type="math/tex">{\hat j}</script>; 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000028"> <p>
The unit vector from <script type="math/tex">\cal {O}</script> parallel to the <script type="math/tex">z</script> axis, denoted by <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ z</script> or <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script>. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 These vectors form a <b class="bf">right</b>-handed set. The Cartesian system is but one possible set of coordinates. Later it will be convenient to introduce different orthogonal sets of basis vectors to deal with (for example) rotating systems.

Any point or vector in Cartesian 3D can be represented in component form by a linear combination of the standard basis vectors. For example 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec a}=a_1{\hat i}+ a_2{\hat j}+a_3{\hat k}</script></span>

 where <script type="math/tex">(a_1,a_2,a_3)</script> are the Cartesian <script type="math/tex">(x,y,z)</script> coordinates of the point <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> with respect to the origin or the vector. These three numbers are called the <b class="bf">components</b> of the vector with respect to the <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}, {\hat j},{\hat k}</script> basis.

<h2 id="a0000000029">1.4 A few comments on derivatives</h2>
<p>
It is important to understand that there are different ways to define vector derivatives. In general, we have to use the tools from vector calculus involving grad, div and curl, but here we will focus on the simplest case where we take derivatives with respect to a single variable (typically time). 
</p>
<p>
As we have already see, vectors can be used to indicate the position, velocity and acceleration of a moving particle. Consider such a particle at a point <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}</script> with coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x,y,z)</script> at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Its position is indicated by a vector <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}</script>, called the position vector, whose tail is at the origin and whose head lies at the point <script type="math/tex">(x,y,z)</script>. 
</p>
<figure id="figure228">
<div class="centered"> <img src="../../notes/course_notes/images/img-0006.png" style="width:216.81pt"/>

<span class="caption_text">The instantaneous position and velocity vectors of a particle at a typical time as it moves along a trajectory between points <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>.</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
Its Cartesian components are <script type="math/tex">x</script>, <script type="math/tex">y</script> and <script type="math/tex">z</script>, which themselves are functions of <script type="math/tex">t</script>, say 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=x(t), \  y=y(t), \  z=z(t).</script></span>
<p>
 The position vector can thus be written as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}={\vec r}(t)=x(t){\hat i}+y(t){\hat j}+z(t){\hat k}.</script></span>
<p>
 This is an example of a <b class="bf">vector function</b>, a vector that depends one (or more) parameters (here time). As <script type="math/tex">t</script> varies <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)</script> describes a curve in 3D space. The position along that curve is parameterised by <script type="math/tex">t</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Let us now consider the positions of the particle at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and <script type="math/tex">t+\delta t</script> where <script type="math/tex">\delta t\rightarrow 0</script>. The distance between these points is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t+\delta t)-{\vec r}(t).</script></span>
<p>
The rate of change of the position as time <script type="math/tex">\delta t \rightarrow 0</script> is nothing other than instantaneous velocity <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}</script> of the particle: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}(t)=\lim _{\delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{{\vec r}(t+\delta t)-{\vec r}(t)}{\delta t}.</script></span>
<p>
 We recognise this as the limit definition of a derivative. 
</p>
<p>
If we consider Cartesian coordinates, the basis vectors <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script>, <script type="math/tex">{\hat j}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> are unit vectors that remain constant relative to the world. Hence any derivative of them with respect to time must be zero<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000030">
<sup class="footnotemark">6</sup>
</a>: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d{\hat i}}{dt}=\frac{d{\hat j}}{dt}=\frac{d{\hat k}}{dt}=0.</script></span>
<p>
 Consequently in Cartesian coordinates the velocity of the particle is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}(t)\equiv \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}={\dot{\vec r}}(t)=\frac{dx(t)}{dt}{\hat i}+\frac{dy(t)}{dt}{\hat j}+\frac{dz(t)}{dt}{\hat k}</script></span>
<p>
 In the limit as <script type="math/tex">\delta t \rightarrow 0</script> the rate of change of position vector with time becomes tangential to the trajectory (see figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figure228">1.3</a>). Hence the velocity vector is tangent to the trajectory of the particle at each time <script type="math/tex">t</script>.

<p>
From now on we shall often refer to the velocity <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}</script> as <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{\vec r}}(t)</script> where the dot “ <script type="math/tex">{\vec\dot {}}</script> ” refers to differentiation with respect to time, <script type="math/tex">d/dt</script>. 
</p>
<p>
The definition of the acceleration is similar – it is the rate of change of velocity with time. Mathematically we have:

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d{\vec v}}{dt}\equiv \frac{d^2{\vec r}}{dt^2}={ \ddot{ \vec r}}(t)=\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}{\hat i}+\frac{d^2y(t)}{dt^2}{\hat j}+\frac{d^2z(t)}{dt^2}{\hat k}</script></span>
<p>
 If <script type="math/tex">{ \ddot{ \vec r}}(t)\ne \vec{0}</script> then the velocity <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{ \vec r}}(t)\ne \vec{0}</script> changes with time. If the <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{ \vec r}}(t)\ne \vec{0}</script> changes with time, then so does the tangent vector to the curve. Hence if a particle travels along a trajectory that is <b class="bf">not</b> straight, then it must be experiencing an acceleration.

Finally, we may also consider the acceleration as the limit

<p>
The acceleration is therefore (the limit of) the scaled difference between the velocities at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and <script type="math/tex">t+\delta t</script> as the particle moves along a trajectory. Since the velocities are tangent to the trajectory, it is not too difficult to see that the acceleration vector points in the direction that the curve is bending.

As we are typically trying to work out how an object moves through space as time progresses, we need two write down Newton’s laws in three space dimensions. We need to work with vectors<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000032">
<sup class="footnotemark">7</sup>
</a>, as in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figure100">1.6</a>. In general, this means that we need some understanding of vector calculus. However, we are going to assume that we have not yet added the relevant tools to our arsenal, and mostly consider problems in one space dimension. Then we have 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x(t)&  \hbox{ the position of a particle }\\ v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt}&  \hbox{ its velocity }\\ \left|\frac{dx}{dt}\right|&  \hbox{ the speed, and }\\ p(t)=m v= m \frac{dx}{dt}&  \hbox{ the momentum } \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
In three dimensions we have to use vectors to represent these quantities. If the position of a body relative to some origin is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)=x(t){\hat i}+y(t){\hat j}+z(t){\hat k}</script></span>
<p>
 at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>, then its velocity <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}(t)</script> is its rate of change of position with respect to time<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000033">
<sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a>, i.e., 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}(t)=\frac{d{\vec r}(t)}{dt}=\frac{dx}{dt}{\hat i}+\frac{dy}{dt}{\hat j}+\frac{dz}{dt}{\hat k}</script></span>
<p>
 Qualitatively Newton’s laws state that force is the amount of push or pull that it takes to change the motion of a body. Quantitatively, <b class="bf">N2</b> states that the <i class="it">sum of all forces</i> <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> acting on a body is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}\equiv \frac{d{\vec p}}{dt}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\vec p = m\vec v</script> is the momentum. 
</p>
<p>
If we insert the definition of momentum into the expression for force we obtain 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=\frac{d\left(m{\vec v}\right)}{dt}=\frac{dm}{dt}{\vec v}+m\frac{d{\vec v}}{dt}=\frac{dm}{dt}\dot{{\vec r}}+m\ddot{{\vec r}}</script></span>
<p>
<b class="bf">N2</b> is often referred to as “force <script type="math/tex">=</script> mass <script type="math/tex">\times </script> acceleration”, or “<script type="math/tex">F=ma</script>”. However we can see that this is in general incorrect. Only if the mass of the body is constant do we have the simplification that <br/>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=m\ddot{{\vec r}}.</script></span>
<p>
<br/>If a force only acts in a single direction, say <script type="math/tex">x</script>, then we have <br/>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}.</script></span>
<p>
<br/>This is a second order differential equation. Given the force, the solution of the differential equation<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000034">
<sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>
</a> will give the position of the particle <script type="math/tex">x</script> at any future time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. 
</p>
<p>
<b class="bf">N2</b> can be written in terms of a first order differential equation involving just the speed of the particle, <script type="math/tex">v(t)</script> as <br/>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">F=m\frac{du}{dt}.</script></span>
<p>
 Here the solution will give the speed of the particle at any future time, <script type="math/tex">u(t)=u_ s(t)</script>, say. We will see below that we will need to provide an initial speed of the particle to specify unambiguously the future speed <script type="math/tex">u_ s(t)</script>. Once this has been done we can predict the future position of the particle by remembering that the speed is just the rate of change of distance with time, i.e.,

 This is again a differential equation that, in principle, could be integrated to obtain <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script>, after specifying an initial position <script type="math/tex">x(0)</script>, say.

<p>
A vector <script type="math/tex">\vec a</script> can be multiplied by a scalar <script type="math/tex">t</script>. The resulting vector <script type="math/tex">t{\vec a}</script> has magnitude <script type="math/tex">|t||{\vec a}|</script> which may be greater or less than <script type="math/tex">|{\vec a}|</script> depending on whether <script type="math/tex">|t|>1</script> or <script type="math/tex"><1</script>, respectively. If <script type="math/tex">t>0</script>, the direction of the vector remains unchanged. If <script type="math/tex">t<0</script>, the direction reverses.

<section class="subsection">
<h3 id="a0000000036">1.6.1 Scalar Product (Dot Product)</h3>
<p>
There are two different ways multiplying vectors with vectors. First of all, the <b class="bf">scalar product</b> combines the two vectors into a single number. The scalar product of the vectors <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}</script> is defined as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec a}\cdot {\vec b}=\vert {\vec a}\vert \vert {\vec b}\vert \cos \theta</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> is the angle between the directions of <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Hence, if <script type="math/tex">{\vec a} = a_1{\hat i} + a_2{\hat j} + a_3{\hat k}</script>, and <script type="math/tex">{\vec b} = b_1{\hat i} + b_2{\hat j}+b_3{\hat k}</script>, then the scalar product is the scalar quantity 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec a}\cdot {\vec b}= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3\;  .</script></span>
<p>
In the special case where <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}\cdot {\vec b}=0</script> then either <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}={\vec0}</script> or <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}={\vec0}</script> or <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}</script> are orthogonal. 
</p>
<p>
We can use the scalar product to work out the length of a vector. Simply note that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec a}\cdot {\vec a}= \vert {\vec a}\vert ^2</script></span>
<p>
 or, in component form, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vert {\vec a}\vert =\sqrt{{\vec a}\cdot {\vec a}}=\sqrt{ a_1^2+ a_2^2 + a_3^2}</script></span>
<p>
Alternatively, we can work out the angle between two vectors. The cosine of the angle <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> between the directions of <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}</script> can be determined from the definition of the scalar product. 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\cos \theta =\frac{{\vec a}\cdot {\vec b}}{\vert {\vec a}\vert \vert {\vec b}\vert }</script></span>
<p>
 which if written in <script type="math/tex">(x,y,z)</script> components is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\cos \theta =\frac{a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3}{\sqrt{(a_1^2+ a_2^2 + a_3^2)(b_1^2+ b_2^2 + b_3^2)}}</script></span>
<p>
We can also use the scalar product to work out the component of one vector in the direction of another. This is often called a “projection”. For example, the component of <script type="math/tex">{\vec b}</script> in the direction of the vector <script type="math/tex">{\vec a}</script> is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{{\vec b}\cdot {\vec a}}{|{\vec a}|} = \vec b \cdot \hat{ a}</script></span>

We can also multiply two vectors in such a way that we obtain a new vector.

A particle of unit mass (in suitable units) moves on the circular path given by

The velocity of the particle is given by 
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{{\vec r}}(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\cos t\;  {\hat i}+\sin t\;  {\hat j} + 0\;  {\hat k}\right)=-\sin t\;  {\hat i}+\cos t \; {\hat j} + 0 \; {\hat k}.</script></span> </span> while the acceleration is

</p>
<p>
Hence we have:

<span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}(t)=-\cos t\;  {\hat i}-\sin t\;  {\hat j} + 0 \; {\hat k} = - \vec r.</script></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
The particle is moving in a circle of radius 1, centred on the origin of coordinates and in the <script type="math/tex">(x,y)</script>-plane. This follows from elimination of <script type="math/tex">t</script> from the Cartesian components of <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)</script>: 
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=\cos t, \  y(t)=\sin t, \  z(t)=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x^2+y^2=1.</script></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
The velocity of this particle is always tangential to this circle (you can show <script type="math/tex">\dot{\vec r}(t)\cdot {\vec r}(t)= 0</script>). The speed of the particle is constant since

The force acting on the particle is of constant magnitude and in this case it is always orthogonal to the velocity since

This force is a “radial” force as it always points radially inwards to the origin. Such forces are also sometimes called “central” or “centripetal” forces, since they “seek” the centre. Note that if the circular path of this particle is caused by it being constrained to move on a smooth wire, then the particle experiences a reactionary force <b class="bf">N3</b> from the wire to keep it in place: this is the “centrifugal” force.

<p>
Note that we would have arrived at the same answer by writing out the problem in terms of the vector components, starting with 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = x \hat i + y \hat j + z \hat k</script></span>
<p>
 and integrating them separately. It is a matter of choice–each strategy has its merits. Either way, we have equations for the displacements in terms of time<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000044">

We can eliminate <script type="math/tex">t</script> between the components by using the first equation to write <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t=\frac{x}{U\cos \theta },</script></span> </span> and substituting for <script type="math/tex">t</script> in the third equation.

</p>
<p>
The particle hits the horizontal plane when <script type="math/tex">z=0</script>, i.e., when <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x\tan \theta -\frac{gx^2\sec ^2\theta }{2U^2}=0</script></span> </span> This is a quadratic equation for <script type="math/tex">x</script>.

</p>
<p>
For fixed launch speed <script type="math/tex">u</script> and gravitational acceleration <script type="math/tex">g</script>, this can be maximised by maximising <script type="math/tex">\sin 2\theta </script>. This leads to <span style="color:#000000">  <script type="math/tex">\sin 2\theta =1 \Rightarrow \theta =\pi /4</script>.</span>
</p>
<p>
In a similar way you can calculate the maximum height achieved in the trajectory as a function of <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> for fixed launch speed. This is known as the safety parabola, since the projectile can never pass outside this curve. 
</p>
<p>
You may also repeat the above example, to find the trajectory of a projectile being launched on a surface that has constant slope and is is inclined at an angle <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> to the horizontal (<script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> could be positive or negative).

<h3 id="a0000000045">1.7.3 Springs</h3>
<p>
A spring is a piece of material that extends its length when a force is applied to it. It has a natural length <script type="math/tex">l</script>, say when it is unstressed. If a force is applied along the spring and is not too large (a strong force might break the spring) then the change in length of the spring is proportional to the magnitude of the force. That is, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hbox{magnitude of force along spring}=k [(\hbox{actual length of spring}) - (\hbox{natural length of spring})].</script></span>
<p>
 The constant of proportionality <script type="math/tex">k</script> is called the spring constant and varies between springs. It has units of N m<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script>. In addition the spring always tries to return to its natural length (this gives the direction of the force). Such a spring, where the force depends linearly on the displacement, is commonly called a <b class="bf">Hookean spring</b>.

<p>
Here we consider the motion of a light (=negligible mass) spring with spring constant <script type="math/tex">k</script> that is attached at one end to a wall and at the other end to a mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> moving on a smooth table (i.e., we will neglect friction). The mass is displaced along the length of the spring to a distance of <script type="math/tex">L</script> metres, held stationary and then released. We want to calculate the subsequent motion of the mass. 
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, we take the coordinate system to be such that the origin is at the location of the end of the unstretched string with <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script> pointing along the string. Hence, the position of the mass will be given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)=x(t)\;  {\hat i}+0\;  {\hat j} + 0\;  {\hat k}.</script></span>
<p>
 where the actual length of the spring at any time is <script type="math/tex">x(t)+l</script>. The force acting on the mass has three parts, one due to the spring, one due to gravity, and the other due to the smooth table it is sitting on. 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F} = -k[(x(t)+l)-l]\; {\hat i} -mg\; {\hat k} + {\vec R}</script></span>
<p>
 Note that we need to find <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> and that we also do not currently know <script type="math/tex">\vec R</script>. (The minus sign in front of <script type="math/tex">k</script> is because an extended spring creates a force that will seek to draw it back to its natural unextended length). 
</p>
<p>
From <b class="bf">N2</b> we obtain: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=m\; \ddot{{\vec r}}(t)</script></span> </span> and if we equate the components of this equation then in the <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> direction we find that we must have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec R} = mg\; {\hat k}\; .</script></span> in order for the mass to stay on the smooth surface. This is the reaction force applied by the table to the mass. </span> In addition, we find that in the <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script> direction we get the equation <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\; \ddot{x}(t)=-k\; x(t)</script></span></span>
</p>
<p>
We expect that both <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">k</script> are positive by definition. The equation is then a second order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and we may use standard methods (we will return to this later) to find the solution. This leads to <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=A\cos \omega t+B\sin \omega t, \qquad \hbox{where }\quad \omega =\sqrt\frac {k}{m},</script></span> </span> with constants <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>. So we require two pieces of information to solve the problem uniquely. From the problem description we know that the initial displacement is <script type="math/tex">L</script> and that the mass is initially stationary. Hence we can write <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(0)=L, \qquad \dot{x}(0)=0.</script></span> </span> Using these to find <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> we arrive at <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)=L\cos \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t \  {\hat i}</script></span> </span>

<h3 id="a0000000046">1.7.4 Motion in a magnetic field</h3>
<p>
As a final example, let us consider a problem from a different part of physics. Newton’s laws of motion don’t just apply to situations that arise out of simple mechanical situations. As an illustration of this (and an example of a more general use of vectors), we turn to the motion of an electrically charged particle in a magnetic field, for example an electron or proton. A magnetic field can be represented by a vector field denoted by <script type="math/tex">{\vec B}</script>. We shall assume that the strength of the magnetic field can be increased to the point where the effect of gravity on the charged particle can be neglected. 
</p>
<p>
The magnetic force <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> acting on a particle, which has an electrical charge <script type="math/tex">q</script> and is moving at velocity <script type="math/tex">\dot{{\vec r}}(t)={\vec v}(t)</script> in a field <script type="math/tex">{\vec B}</script>, is given (experimentally) by the vector product<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000047">
<sup class="footnotemark">14</sup>
</a>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=q\left({\vec v}\times {\vec B}\right).</script></span>
<p>
We are interested in determining the path the particle takes in a particular magnetic field. We shall suppose the particle is of constant mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and that the magnetic field (constant throughout the region of interest) is of the form <script type="math/tex">{\vec B}=B{\vec k}</script> relative to the reference frame. Let us assume that initially the particle is located at <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(0)={\vec0}</script> with velocity <script type="math/tex">\dot{{\vec r}}(0)={\hat i}+{\hat k}</script>. We now use <b class="bf">N2</b> and the given form of the force to find the trajectory of the particle. 
</p>

<span class="caption_text">Forces acting on a negatively charged particle in a magnetic field.</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
<b class="bf">N2</b> gives the equation of motion of the particle as 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  {\vec F}=m\ddot{\vec r}(t)&  =&  q\left({\vec v}\times {\vec B}\right) \\ &  = &  q\left(\dot{\vec r}\times {\vec B}\right) \\ &  = &  q\left(\dot{\vec r}\times B{\hat k}\right) \\ m\ddot{\vec r}(t) &  = &  qB\left(\dot{\vec r}\times {\hat k}\right). \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 This looks awful! Our approach to solving this problem will be to write everything out in component form and then try to solve the resulting equations. However, to show that it is possible to find some properties of the solution using vector manipulations we note that: If we take the scalar product of both sides of the <b class="bf">N2</b> equation with the velocity vector <script type="math/tex">\dot{\vec r}</script> we get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r}\cdot \ddot{\vec r} = \frac{qB}{m}\dot{\vec r}\cdot \left(\dot{\vec r}\times {\hat k}\right) = 0.</script></span>
<p>
The right hand side of the equation vanishes because a vector product of any two vectors is, by definition, orthogonal to both the vectors and the dot product of any vector with a vector that is orthogonal to it is zero. Thus, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r} \cdot \ddot{\vec r} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d\left( \dot{\vec r}\cdot \dot{\vec r}\right)}{dt} =\frac{1}{2}\frac{d|\dot{\vec r}|^2}{dt}=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad |\dot{\vec r}|^2={\rm constant}.</script></span>
<p>
 We have found that, for this problem, the speed of the particle will be constant. However, this does not mean that there is no force acting on the particle – the direction of the velocity could still be changing. 
</p>
<p>
To find the path of the particle we now write everything in the <b class="bf">N2</b> equation in component form—in this case it is a bit trickier to “integrate” the vector equation—using 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)= x(t)\; {\hat i} + y(t)\; {\hat j} + z(t)\; {\hat k}\; .</script></span>
<p>
 Hence <b class="bf">N2</b> becomes 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \ddot{x}(t)\; {\hat i} + \ddot{y}(t)\; {\hat j} + \ddot{z}(t)\; {\hat k}&  = &  \frac{qB}{m}\left|\begin{array}{ccc}{\hat i} &  {\hat j} &  {\hat k} \\ \dot{x} &  \dot{y} &  \dot{z} \\ 0 &  0 &  1\end{array}\right| \\ & =&  \frac{qB}{m} \left(\dot{y}\; {\hat i}-\dot{x}\; {\hat j}\right). \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Rewriting the initial data in component form we have 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \ddot{x}(t)=\frac{qB}{m}\dot{y},&  \qquad x(0)=0, & \qquad \dot{x}(0)=1\\ \ddot{y}(t)=-\frac{qB}{m}\dot{x},&  \qquad y(0)=0, & \qquad \dot{y}(0)=0 \\ \ddot{z}(t)=0, & \qquad z(0)=0, & \qquad \dot{z}(0)=1. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 We must now solve these three ordinary differential equations. The <script type="math/tex">z</script> equation is easy, and using the initial conditions gives <script type="math/tex">z=t</script>. In other words, in the <script type="math/tex">z</script> direction, the particle moves at constant speed 1 ms<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script> in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, passing through <script type="math/tex">z=0</script> when <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
The other two equations are coupled: the <script type="math/tex">x</script> depends on <script type="math/tex">y</script> and vice-versa and we cannot solve one without the other. However, we can solve this system by eliminating variables to make a single higher-order differential equation. To eliminate <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script> we differentiate the <script type="math/tex">\ddot{x}</script> equation once and then observe that the right-hand side only involves <script type="math/tex">\ddot{y}(t)</script>. Using the second component equation we can then write  
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"><script type="math/tex">{x}=\frac{qB}{m}\ddot{y}= \frac{qB}{m}\left(-\frac{qB}{m}\dot{x}\right) =-\left(\frac{qB}{m}\right)^2\dot{x}. </script></span>
<p>
 This is a third order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve this, let us introduce a new variable <script type="math/tex">u(t)</script> which is the velocity in the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-direction and hence take <script type="math/tex">\dot{x}=u(t)</script>. Using this in the equation we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{u}+\left(\frac{qB}{m}\right)^2u=0.</script></span>
<p>
 This is a second order linear harmonic oscillator-type equation, and we know how to deal with this. The standard approach leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">u(t)=C\cos \lambda t+D\sin \lambda t, \qquad \lambda =\frac{q B}{m},</script></span>
<p>
 for constants <script type="math/tex">C</script> and <script type="math/tex">D</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">u=\dot{x}</script>, we now just have to integrate this expression one more time with respect to <script type="math/tex">t</script> to obtain <script type="math/tex">x</script>. 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=\frac{C}{\lambda }\sin \lambda t-\frac{D}{\lambda }\cos \lambda t + E, \qquad \lambda =\frac{q B}{m}.</script></span>
<p>
 We can then immediately deduce <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script> from the coupled equation above which gives 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{y}=\frac{1}{\lambda } \ddot{x} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad y(t)=\frac{1}{\lambda } \dot{x(t)}+F</script></span>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">y(t)=\frac{C}{\lambda }\cos \lambda t+\frac{D}{\lambda }\sin \lambda t+F, \qquad \lambda =\frac{q B}{m}.</script></span>
<p>
 We now apply the initial data. Recall that we had: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x(0)& =& 0 \qquad \Rightarrow E=\frac{D}{\lambda }, \\ \dot{x}(0)& =& 1 \qquad \Rightarrow C=1,\\ y(0)& =& 0 \qquad \Rightarrow F=-\frac{C}{\lambda }, \\ \dot{y}(0)& =& 0 \qquad \Rightarrow D=0. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Rightarrow C=1, D=0, E=0, F=-\frac{1}{\lambda }</script></span>
<p>
 from which we deduce that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)=\frac{1}{\lambda }\sin \lambda t \  {\vec i}+\frac{1}{\lambda }(\cos \lambda t - 1) \  {\hat j} + t \  {\hat k},</script></span>
<p>
Clearly the <script type="math/tex">(x,y)</script> components are related by the formula 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2+\left(y+\frac{1}{\lambda }\right)^2=\frac{1}{\lambda ^2}, \qquad z=t</script></span>

<h1 id="a0000000048">Air resistance and friction</h1>
<p>
So far we have explored forces that do not <i class="it">per se</i> resist the motion—we have assumed that there is no friction or air resistance. This is not our everyday reality. While energy is conserved at a fundamental level, it does not appear to be conserved in many things we do. At a microscopic level, kinetic energy is transferred to the atoms in the floor you may be trying to slide across, manifesting itself as heat. But if we only want to know how far our socks will slide, the details of the atomic processes are of little interest. Instead, we often summarise everything in a single, macroscopic force that we call friction. This is a messy business, but the effective description is quite simple. 
</p>
<p>
In this chapter we consider the effect of such forces. Newton’s laws formally remain unchanged, but the presence of resistive forces complicates the problem we have to solve. 
</p>
<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000049">2.1 Air Resistance</h2>
<p>
A particle moving through a fluid (or a gas, such as air!) is subject to a drag force. This arises because in moving through the liquid, the particle has to push the fluid molecules out of the way.

 Now suppose that <script type="math/tex">H(y)</script> is the integral of <script type="math/tex">1/f(y)</script>, i.e., 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">H’(y)=\frac{1}{f(y)}</script></span>
<p>
 Then, using the chain rule we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dx}H(y(x))=H’(y(x))\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{f(y)}\frac{dy}{dx}.</script></span>
<p>
Hence, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral on the left-hand side above becomes 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="sepint">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}\int {\frac{1}{f\left( y \right)}} \; \frac{dy}{dx}\; dx=\int \left(\frac{d}{dx}H(y(x))\right)dx=H(y)+c \label{sepint}\tag{2.1}\end{equation}</script>
</div>
<p>
 If you look carefully at <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#sepint">(2.1)</a>, effectively all we did was evaluate the integral of <script type="math/tex">1/f(y)</script> with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script>: the answer being the integral <script type="math/tex">H(y)</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Note that you could have obtained the same result just by “cancelling” the <script type="math/tex">dx</script> top and bottom in the integral on the left-hand side and integrating with respect to <script type="math/tex">dy</script>. Hence, a short cut for the integration is as follows: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{f\left( y \right)}\; \frac{dy}{dx}=1\quad \Rightarrow \quad \int {\frac{1}{f\left( y \right)}} \;  {dy \over dx}\; {dx}=\int 1\; dx \qquad \Rightarrow \int {\frac{1}{f\left( y \right)}} \; dy=x+C</script></span>
<p>
 The last integral with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script> just has to be evaluated depending on what <script type="math/tex">f(y)</script> is and <script type="math/tex">C</script> is an arbitrary constant. 
</p>
<p>
However, this cancellation trick is (formally) quite naughty, since the derivative <script type="math/tex">dy/dx</script> is not a fraction that can be cancelled! Still, this notational short cut is justified due to the argument outlined above. Hence everybody does it. Just remember why it is allowed! 
</p>
<p>
A related kind of first order equation contains functions of <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> such that it is possible to separate them into two terms, one on each side of the equal sign, one a function of <script type="math/tex">x</script> only and the other only a function of <script type="math/tex">y</script>. In general these equations take the form. <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)f(y).</script></span> </span> Separating the terms we may integrate with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> only: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int {\frac{1}{f(y)}\; \frac{dy}{dx}\; dx} = \int g\left( x \right)\; dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \frac{1}{f(y)}\; dy =\int g\left( x \right)\; dx</script></span>
<p>
Note that we are using the naughty cancellation trick between derivatives again. This is justified by the same procedure as outlined above.

The first equation is separable and can be integrated: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _{U\cos \theta }^ u \frac{du}{u}=-\frac{\gamma }{m}\int _0^ t dt \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} \large [ \ln u \large ]^ u_{U\cos \theta } = -\frac{\gamma t}{m} \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} u(t)=U\cos \theta \exp {\left(-\frac{\gamma }{m}t\right)}.</script></span> </span> Using the equation <script type="math/tex">u(t)=\dot{x}(t)</script> we can integrate this expression once more and use the fact that <script type="math/tex">x(0)=0</script> to obtain <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{x}(t)=U\cos \theta \exp \left(-\frac{\gamma }{m}t\right), \  x(0)=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x(t)=\frac{mU\cos \theta }{\gamma }\left\{ 1-\exp \left(-\frac{\gamma }{m}t\right)\right\}</script></span> </span>

The second equation can be solved in a similar manner <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\frac{dv}{dt} = -\gamma v \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} \int \frac{dv}{v} = -\frac{\gamma }{m} \int dt</script></span> </span> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} \ln v = -\frac{\gamma t}{m} + \ln A \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} v(t) = A \exp \left(-\frac{\gamma }{m} t\right)</script></span> </span> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v(0)=0, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad v(t)=0.</script></span> </span> Hence we have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{y}(t)=0, \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad y(t)=B, \qquad {\rm but} \  y(0)=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad B=0 \qquad \therefore  y(t)=0.</script></span> </span> So the projectile always stays in the <script type="math/tex">y=0</script> plane and never has a non-zero <script type="math/tex">{\hat j}</script> component (this should have been obvious from the start!).

The third equation is also separable and can be solved as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _{U\sin \theta }^ w\frac{dw}{(mg/\gamma +w)}=-\frac{\gamma }{m} \int _{0}^ tdt \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad w(t)=-\frac{mg}{\gamma }+\left(U\sin \theta +\frac{mg}{\gamma }\right)\exp \left({-\frac{\gamma }{m}t}\right)</script></span> </span> This can be integrated to give the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-component as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{z}(t)=-\frac{mg}{\gamma }+\left(U\sin \theta +\frac{mg}{\gamma }\right) \exp \left({-\frac{\gamma }{m}t}\right)</script></span> </span> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Rightarrow z(t)=-\frac{mgt}{\gamma }+\frac{m}{\gamma }\left(U\sin \theta +\frac{mg}{\gamma }\right) \left\{ 1-\exp \left({-\frac{\gamma }{m}t}\right)\right\}</script></span> </span>

<h2 id="a0000000053">2.4 Reminder: Linear Equations and integrating factors</h2>
<p>
Many first order ordinary differential equations can be solved by multiplying both sides by a suitable factor, called an <i class="it">integrating factor</i> <script type="math/tex">R(x,y)</script>. Finding such an integrating factor can be difficult but there is a simple rule for the case of a linear first-order ordinary differential equations. 
</p>
<p>
An equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dy}{dx}+p\left( x \right)y=q\left( x \right)</script></span>
<p>
 is called a <i class="it">linear first order differential equation</i> and can be solved by use of an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R\left( x \right)=\exp \left[ {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right].</script></span>
<p>
 Note that the integrating factor is usually taken not to contain an arbitrary constant (since this will be a multiplicative factor that can be cancelled on both sides of the equation). 
</p>
<p>
We solve the equation by multiplying through by <script type="math/tex">R\left( x \right)</script>, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)\frac{dy}{dx}+\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)p\left( x \right)y=\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)q\left( x \right).</script></span>
<p>
The left-hand side can then be recognised as an exact derivative: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s\right)ds } \right)\frac{dy}{dx}+\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)p\left( x \right)y=\frac{d}{dx}\left[ {y\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)} \right]</script></span>
<p>
 where we have used the fundamental theorem of calculus: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int ^ x p(s) ds\right).</script></span>
<p>
 Hence, we can write the linear equation above as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dx}\left( {y\; \exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)} \right)=q\left( x \right)\exp \left( {\int ^ x p\left( s \right)ds } \right)</script></span>
<p>
 or more simply as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dx}\Big( y\;  R(x)\Big)=q(x) R(x).</script></span>
<p>
 Both sides can now be integrated directly with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> to obtain a solution for <script type="math/tex">y(x)</script>: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  y(x)R(x)& =& \int ^ x q(s)R(s) ds +C \\ \Rightarrow y(x)& =& \frac{1}{R(x)}\int ^ x q(s)R(s)ds +\frac{C}{R(x)}. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Note that if you chose not to use the initial conditions in the integration limits here, so that the arbitrary constant <script type="math/tex">C</script> is automatically found as part of the definite integration progress, it is vital that you don’t forget to put <script type="math/tex">C</script> on the right hand side <b class="bf">before</b> you ultimately divide through by <script type="math/tex">R(x)</script> to obtain <script type="math/tex">y(x)</script>. Otherwise you miss out a whole term in the solution. 
</p>
<p>
Note: When seeking the integrating factor be careful. For example for the equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x\frac{dy}{dx}-x^2\; y=e^{3x},</script></span>
<p>
 first put the equation in the <b class="bf">standard</b> form with the coefficient of <script type="math/tex">dy/dx</script> being unity and a function of <script type="math/tex">x</script> multiplying a single linear term in <script type="math/tex">y</script>. 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dy}{dx}-x\; y=\frac{e^{3x}}{x},</script></span>
<p>
 and then find the integrating factor (taking care to include the correct sign of <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R(x)=\exp \left(\int p\left( x \right)dx\right) =\exp \left( \int -x\; dx \right)=\exp \left( {-x^2/2} \right).</script></span>
<p>
Also, you will have noticed that for a first order equation, there is one arbitrary constant in the general solution. Thus to find a specific solution you need to provide one additional bit of information, or boundary condition, to determine the specific value of the arbitrary constant.

<h2 id="a0000000054">2.5 Alternative solution to the projectile problem</h2>
<p>
While it is often natural to solve the problem in component form (as we did above), we have already seen that simple ballistic motion can also be solve directly as a vector equation. As before, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m {d \vec v \over dt} = m \vec g - \gamma \vec v</script></span>
<p>
 This is a linear equation, so we can solve it using an integrating factor. We have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{d \over dt} \left( e^{\gamma t \over m} \vec v \right) = e^{\gamma t \over m} \vec g</script></span>
<p>
 which leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec v = {m \over \gamma } \vec g + {\vec c} e^{-\gamma t/m}</script></span>
<p>
 where the integration constant, <script type="math/tex">\vec c</script>, is fixed by the initial speed. Suppose that we have <script type="math/tex">\vec v = \vec u</script> at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>. Then it follows that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec v = {m \over \gamma } \vec g +\left( \vec u - {m \over \gamma } \vec g \right) e^{-\gamma t/m}</script></span>
<p>
 If we want the position, we can integrate again. This leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = { m\over \gamma } \vec g t - {m \over \gamma }\left( \vec u - {m \over \gamma } \vec g \right) e^{-\gamma t/m} + \vec b</script></span>
<p>
 If we let <script type="math/tex">\vec r=0</script> at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>, then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r= { m\over \gamma } \vec g t + {m \over \gamma }\left( \vec u - {m \over \gamma } \vec g \right) \left( 1- e^{-\gamma t/m} \right)</script></span>
<p>
We can make contact with the previous calculation by expanding our result in components. Let <script type="math/tex">\vec r = (x,y,z)</script> and send the projectile off with initial velocity <script type="math/tex">\vec u = (u \cos \theta , 0, u \sin \theta )</script>. With gravity acting downwards, so <script type="math/tex">\vec g = (0, 0,-g)</script>, our vector equation becomes three equations. One is trivial: <script type="math/tex">y=0</script>. The other two are 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = {m\over \gamma } u \cos \theta \left( 1- e^{-\gamma t/m} \right)</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z = - {mgt \over \gamma } + {m \over \gamma } \left( u \sin \theta + {mg \over \gamma } \right) \left( 1- e^{-\gamma t/m} \right)</script></span>
<p>
 The time scale<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000055">
<sup class="footnotemark">16</sup>
</a> <script type="math/tex">m/\gamma </script> is important. For <script type="math/tex">t\gg m/\gamma </script>, the horizontal position is essentially constant. By this time, the particle is dropping more or less vertically. The trajectory is not symmetric. 
</p>
<p>
We may also consider what happens when friction is small. A couple of terms look as if they are going to become singular (as we would appear to divide by zero) in this limit, but that seems unphysical. To resolve this, we should ask what <script type="math/tex">\gamma </script> is small relative to. In the present case, the answer lies in the exponential terms. To say that <script type="math/tex">\gamma </script> is small, really means <script type="math/tex">\gamma \ll m/t</script> or, in other words, it means that we are looking at short times, <script type="math/tex">t\ll m/\gamma </script>. Then we can expand the exponential in a Taylor series. Reverting to the vector form of the equation, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">e^{-\gamma t/m} \approx 1 - {\gamma t \over m} + \ldots</script></span>
<p>
 so we find 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}  \vec r = { m\over \gamma } \vec g t + {m \over \gamma }\left( \vec u - {m \over \gamma } \vec g \right) \left[ 1 - 1 + \gamma {t \over m} - {1\over 2} \left( {\gamma t \over m} \right)^2 + \ldots \right] \\ = \vec u t + {1\over 2} \vec g t^2 + \mathcal O \left( {\gamma t \over m} \right) \nonumber \end{multline}</script></span>
<p>
 This is the usual projectile result.

<h2 id="a0000000056">2.6 Terminal velocity</h2>
<p>
Let us now consider a particle of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> moving in a constant gravitational field, subject to quadratic friction. We measure the height <script type="math/tex">z</script> to be in the upwards direction, meaning that if <script type="math/tex">v = dz/dt > 0</script>, the particle is going up. We will look at the cases where the particle goes up and goes down separately. 
</p>
<p>
First suppose that we drop the particle from some height. The equation of motion is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m {dv \over dt} = - mg + \gamma v^2</script></span>
<p>
 It is worth commenting on the minus signs on the right-hand side. Gravity acts downwards, so comes with a minus sign. Since the particle is falling down, friction is acting upwards so comes with a plus sign. Dividing through by <script type="math/tex">m</script>, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{dv \over dt} = - g + {\gamma \over m} v^2</script></span>
<p>
 Integrating this, we get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t = - \int _0^ v {dv’ \over g - \gamma v^{\prime 2}/m}</script></span>
<p>
This can be worked out—either through the substitution <script type="math/tex">v=\sqrt{mg/\gamma } \tanh x</script> or partial fractions (which may be the easiest route)—leading to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t = - \sqrt{ m \over \gamma g} \tanh ^{-1} \left( \sqrt{\gamma \over mg} v \right)</script></span>
<p>
 which we can invert to get the speed as a function of time 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = - \sqrt{ mg \over \gamma } \tanh \left( \sqrt{ \gamma g \over m} t\right)</script></span>
<p>
 This illustrates the effect of the air resistance. As time increases, the velocity does not increase without bound. Instead, the particle reaches a maximum speed (the terminal velocity) 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v \longrightarrow - \sqrt{mg \over \gamma } \  , \qquad \mbox{as} \  t \to \infty</script></span>
<p>
The sign is negative because the particle is falling downwards. Note that if all we want is the terminal velocity, then we do not need to go through the whole calculation. We can simply look for solutions with constant speed, so <script type="math/tex">dv/dt = 0</script>. This gives us the same answer. The advantage of going through the full calculation is that we learn how the velocity approaches its terminal value. 
</p>
<p>
This example teaches us an important lesson. A small animal (like a mouse) may survive a fall where a large animal (say, an elephant) will not<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000057">
<sup class="footnotemark">17</sup>
</a>. The point is that, if we compare objects of equal density the masses scale as the volume, meaning <script type="math/tex"> m\sim L^3</script> where <script type="math/tex">L</script> is the linear size of the object. In contrast, the coefficient of friction usually scales as surface area, <script type="math/tex">\gamma \sim L^2</script>. This means that the terminal velocity depends on size. For objects of equal density, we expect the terminal velocity to scale as <script type="math/tex">v \sim \sqrt{L}</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Let us now throw the object upwards. Since both gravity and friction are then acting downwards, we get a flip of a minus sign in the equation of motion. It is now 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{dv \over dt} = - g - {\gamma \over m} v^2</script></span>
<p>
 Suppose that we throw the object up with initial speed <script type="math/tex">u</script> and we want to figure out the maximum height, <script type="math/tex">h</script>, that it reaches. We could follow our earlier calculation and integrate the equation to determine <script type="math/tex">v = v(t</script>). But since we are not asking about time, it is much better to instead consider velocity as a function of distance: <script type="math/tex">v = v(z)</script>.

 Using <script type="math/tex">y=v^2</script> we can integrate this to get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _{u^2}^0 {dy \over g+\gamma y/m} = - 2\int _0^ h dz \quad \longrightarrow \quad {m\over \gamma } \left[ \log \left( g + {\gamma y\over m} \right) \right]_{y=u^2}^{y=0} = - 2h</script></span>
<p>
 That is, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">h = {m \over 2\gamma } \log \left( 1 + {\gamma u^2 \over mg} \right)</script></span>
<p>
Here, it is worth looking at what happens when the effect of friction is small. Naively, it looks like we are in trouble because as <script type="math/tex">\gamma \to 0</script>, the term in front gets large. But surely the height should not go to infinity just because the friction is small. The resolution to this is that the log is also getting small in this limit. Expanding as a Taylor series, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">h = {u^2 \over 2g} \left( 1 - {\gamma u^2 \over 2mg} + \ldots \right)</script></span>
<p>
 The leading term is the answer we would get in the absence of friction; the subleading terms tell us how much the friction, <script type="math/tex">\gamma </script>, affects the attained height.

<h2 id="a0000000059">2.7 Friction</h2>
<p>
Friction is the resistive force that occurs when two solid surfaces pressed together attempt to slide over each other. Even the apparently macroscopically smoothest of surfaces will, in practice, give rise to frictional forces, since on the macroscopic scale the surfaces are imperfect and so are rough. The surfaces then snag on and scrap against each other’s microscopic mountain ranges as they move past each other. <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000060">
<sup class="footnotemark">19</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
Consider two solid, reasonably flat surfaces in contact. Assume they are both stationary and are being pushed together by a normal force <script type="math/tex">{\vec N}</script>. This normal force is the component orthogonal to the surfaces of any force holding the surfaces together. For example you might consider the upper surface to be a book and the lower surface to be a horizontal table in which case the normal force would be due to the weight of the book.

<p>
As there is no acceleration we can apply <script type="math/tex">{\bf N2}</script> to infer that there will be a reactive force <script type="math/tex">{\vec R}</script> due to the lower surface acting on the upper surface (the table pushing on the book) of equal magnitude to <script type="math/tex">{\vec N}</script>, but in the opposite direction.

<p>
The rough surface creates a frictional force <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}_ F</script> that acts tangentially to each surface to oppose any translational force applied in an orthogonal direction to <script type="math/tex">{\vec R}</script> (see diagram). If a translational force, <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}_{{\rm app}}</script>, is applied to the upper surface (the book) then the surfaces will not slide over each other and hence will remain stationary only as long as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">|{\vec F}_{{\rm app}}|\le \mu _ s|{\vec R}|,</script></span> </span> where <script type="math/tex"> \mu _ s</script> is an experimentally determined positive number called the <b class="bf">coefficient of static friction</b>. If <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}_{\rm appl}</script> is greater in magnitude than the static frictional force then the surfaces will slide over each other. Once the surfaces start to slide there will still be a frictional force tangential to the surfaces but it will have a magnitude <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">|{\vec F}_ F| =\mu _ k|{\vec R}|,</script></span> </span> and act in a direction to oppose the sliding motion. The experimentally determined positive number <script type="math/tex">\mu _ k</script> is called the <b class="bf">coefficient of kinetic friction</b> (also sometimes known as the coefficient of dynamic friction). Suppose the instantaneous motion of one surface relative to another in contact with it is in the direction <script type="math/tex">{ {\hat v}}\ne {\vec0}</script>. In vector notation the friction force resisting the motion can then be written as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}_ F=-\mu _ k|{\vec R}|{{\hat v}}.</script></span> </span> This force continues to act until the surfaces become stationary at which time the static friction returns. 
</p>
<p>
Several points are worth making: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000061">
<li id="a0000000062"> <p>
the coefficients of friction are properties of the surfaces in contact. Hence the coefficient of friction between two wooden surfaces can be expected to be different from that between a steel and wood surface. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000063"> <p>
Frictional forces are independent of the area of the surface in contact, they depend only on the magnitude of the normal force with which the surfaces are pushed together. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000064"> <p>
Usually <script type="math/tex">\mu _ k\le \mu _ s</script>, however to simplify algebra they are often taken as being equal and take a value less than 1, i.e., 
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu _ k=\mu _ s<1.</script></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
We shall follow this procedure here. Note that coefficients of friction greater than unity only occur if the surfaces interlock and that a book sliding on a table might have values around <script type="math/tex">0.2</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000065"> <p>
Note that there is also similarly defined <b class="bf">coefficient of rolling friction</b> <script type="math/tex">\mu _ s</script> which is applicable to situations where two surfaces are only in minimal contact, for example a cart wheel in contact with the road. However we shall not deal so much with this situation.

We can attack problems involving friction using Newton’s laws of motion.

 [width=%+10mm]A child on a slide 
</p>
<p>
Consider a straight slide inclined at an angle <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> to the horizontal. Suppose a child of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> attempts to slide down the slide under gravity of magnitude <script type="math/tex">g</script>. The forces acting on the child are

</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000069"> <p>
a force of reaction <script type="math/tex">{\vec R}</script> that acts normal to the slide (that this exists is due to <b class="bf">N3</b> as without it the child would fall through the slide);

<li id="a0000000070"> <p>
the frictional force <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}_ F</script> acting tangentially to the slide and in a direction (up or down the slide) to oppose any motion. The coefficient of friction is supposed to be <script type="math/tex">\mu </script>. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 These forces are summarised in the diagram below. 
</p>
<p>
We can use <b class="bf">N2</b> to analyse the situation. We fix a Cartesian coordinate frame at the base of the slide and orient the axes such that <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script> points down the tangent to the slide, <script type="math/tex">{\hat j}</script> points into the page and <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> points away from the ground but normal to the slide. 
</p>
<p>
Note that there is no fixed rule that says that a Cartesian coordinate system has to be oriented so that <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> has to point directly upwards! In fact for this problem this orientation saves a lot of algebraic effort. If you don’t believe this, try orienting the coordinates with <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script> horizontal and <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> pointing upwards and repeating the analysis. 
</p>
<p>
Then we can write the normal and frictional forces as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}_ F=-F_ F \  {\hat i}, \qquad {\vec R}=R \  {\hat k}.</script></span> </span> If the position of the child on the slide is given by <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)=x(t){\hat i}+y(t){\hat j}+z(t){\hat k}</script> with respect to this coordinate frame then <b class="bf">N2</b> says that <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\;  \ddot{\vec{r}}(t)={\vec F}_ F+{\vec R}+{\vec W}.</script></span> </span> where

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec W} = mg\sin \theta \; {\hat i} + 0{\hat j} - mg\cos \theta \; {\hat k}</script></span>
<p>
 To solve this problem we do exactly as before and rewrite the problem in component form. By symmetry, <script type="math/tex">y(t)=0</script> for all time, so we will not need to solve for <script type="math/tex">y(t)</script>. We find: 
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex">\hat i</script> component: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot{x}(t)=mg\sin \theta -F_ F.</script></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> component: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot{z}(t)=R-mg\cos \theta .</script></span> </span> Assuming that the child does not spontaneously fly off the slide (i.e., we assume no motion in the <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> direction) we must have no acceleration in this direction <script type="math/tex">\Rightarrow \ddot{z}(t)</script>=0. Hence this last equation reduces to <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R=mg\cos \theta ,</script></span> </span> and gives us an expression relating the normal reaction <script type="math/tex">R</script> to the weight <script type="math/tex">mg</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Two possible situations can arise. 
</p>
<p>
<b class="bf">1. The child is just stationary, on the point of sliding.</b> In this case we must have <script type="math/tex">\ddot x(t)=0</script>: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot{x}(t)=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad F_ F=mg\sin \theta .</script></span></span> Using the fact that, in this case, <script type="math/tex">F_ F=\mu R</script> we combine this result with the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-component to arrive at: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R=mg\cos \theta , \  \  F_ F=mg\sin \theta , \  \  F_ F=\mu R \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \tan \theta =\mu ,</script></span></span> <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta =\arctan \mu .</script></span> </span> This is a (rather scary for the child) way to determine <script type="math/tex">\mu _ s</script>. The angle of the slide <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> is altered until the child first just starts to move. <script type="math/tex">\mu _ s</script> is then just the tangent of the angle of inclination at which slipping first occurs. 
</p>
<p>
<b class="bf">2.

</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000071">

</ul>
<p>
 Integrating once more with respect to <script type="math/tex">t</script> we obtain:

<h2 id="a0000000077">2.8 Addendum: Taylor expansions</h2>
<p>
The Taylor series is one of the most useful mathematical tools applied to real life problems. As in the example of potential motion near equilibrium, we can often use a Taylor series to approximate a complicated function by a (simpler) polynomial function. 
</p>
<p>
The starting point is Taylor’s theorem (which we state without proof, as we are mainly interested in the applications): 
</p>
<p>
Let <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> be continuous and differentiable an infinite number of times at point <script type="math/tex">x=a</script> (i.e., <script type="math/tex">f</script> and all of its derivatives <script type="math/tex">f', f'',\ldots </script> exist at <script type="math/tex">x=a</script>). Then <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> can be expanded about the point <script type="math/tex">x=a</script> in terms of powers of <script type="math/tex">(x-a)</script>, and this expansion is given by the formula <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline*}  f(x) = \textcolor{black}{ f(a) + (x-a) f'(a) + {{(x-a)^2} \over 2!} f''(a) + \dots } \\ \textcolor{black}{ + \frac{(x-a)^ n}{n!} f^{(n)}(a) +O(x-a)^{n+1} } \end{multline*}</script></span>
<p>
 This is a <b class="bf">Taylor expansion</b>. It has the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = P_ n(x) + O(x-a)^{n+1}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">P_ n(x)</script> is a polynomial of degree <script type="math/tex">n</script> and <script type="math/tex">O(x-a)^{n+1}</script> is a remainder term. The remainder term reminds us that in writing the Taylor expansion explicitly up to the term <script type="math/tex">\propto (x-a)^ n</script> (“up to order n”) we are omitting terms “of order <script type="math/tex">(x-a)^{n+1}</script> and higher”. 
</p>
<p>
For <script type="math/tex">x</script> close to <script type="math/tex">a</script>, we can expect the remainder term to be small (since <script type="math/tex">x-a</script> is small), so that <script type="math/tex">f(x) \simeq P_{n} (x)</script>. Thus Taylor’s theorem enables us to approximate functions by polynomials. 
</p>
<p>
In many cases the remainder term goes to zero as <script type="math/tex">n \rightarrow \infty </script> and the Taylor series expansion of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> takes the form of a possibly infinite, but convergent, series. 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]The exponential 
</p>
<p>
As an example, let us determine the Taylor series expansion of the function <script type="math/tex">f(x)=e^ x</script> about <script type="math/tex">x=0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
We first establish the necessary data. We know that we need the derivatives: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*} & & f(x)= e^ x \qquad f’(x)=\textcolor{black}{e^ x} \qquad f”(x)=\textcolor{black}{e^ x} \quad \textcolor{black}{\dots }\\ & & f(0)= \textcolor{black}{e^0 = 1 } \quad f’(0)=\textcolor{black}{e^0=1} \quad f”(0)=\textcolor{black}{e^0=1} \quad \textcolor{black}{\dots } \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Then we use this in the Taylor series expansion with <script type="math/tex">a=0</script>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \textcolor{black}{1 + x + {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^3 \over 3!} + {x^4 \over 4!} + \dots = \sum _{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} x^ n}</script></span>
<p>
Similarly, we can work out the Taylor series expansion of the function <script type="math/tex">f(x)=\cos x</script> about <script type="math/tex">x=0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
In this case, we need: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  f(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\cos x } \  , \qquad f(0) = \textcolor{black}{1} \\ f’(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{-\sin x} \  , \qquad f’(0) = \textcolor{black}{0} \\ f”(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{ -\cos x} \  , \qquad f”(0) = \textcolor{black}{-1} \\ f”’(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\sin x} \  , \qquad f”’(0) = \textcolor{black}{0} \\ f^{(4)} (x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\cos x } \  , \qquad f^{(4)}(0) = \textcolor{black}{1} \\ \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 and we arrive at 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \textcolor{black}{1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} - {x^6 \over 6!} + \dots =\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ k}{(2k)!} x^{2k} }</script></span>

We have already seen the simple example of a harmonic oscillator. With a better understanding of simple differential equations, we can turn to more concrete applications and consider more complicated oscillating systems.

<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000079">3.1 Reminder: Homogeneous second order constant coefficient equations</h2>
<p>
Second order differential equations are more complicated—we can no longer get away with “integrating”—but we can readily deal with a particular class of equations: linear equations with constant coefficients. 
</p>
<p>
In general we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">a\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+b\frac{dx}{dt}+cx=0</script></span>
<p>
 First we take a homogeneous equation (no driving force) and divide through by <script type="math/tex">a</script> (this is allowed as <script type="math/tex">a</script> – the coefficient multiplying the second derivative – is non-zero which must be true, otherwise the equation would not be second order!) 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{b}{a}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{c}{a}x=0\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+m\frac{dx}{dt}+nx=0</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">n</script> are constants. 
</p>
<p>
To find the general solution we make the <b class="bf">ansatz</b> that there is a solution of the form: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=Ae^{kt}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">k</script> are constants that we will try to find. Now 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dx}{dt}=Ake^{kt},\quad \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=Ak^2e^{kt}</script></span>
<p>
 Thus if <script type="math/tex">x=A\exp \left( {kt} \right)</script> is a solution of the homogeneous equation by substituting it into the equation we see that we must have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">Ak^2e^{kt}+mAke^{kt}+nAe^{kt}=0</script></span>
<p>
 The <script type="math/tex">\exp \left( {kt} \right)</script> can be divided through as it is always non-zero for finite <script type="math/tex">t</script>. We can also divide through by <script type="math/tex">A</script>, since this must be non-zero for a <b class="bf">non-trivial</b> solution (a solution that is not <script type="math/tex">x(t)\equiv 0</script>). This leaves what is called the <b class="bfseries">auxiliary</b> equation of the differential equation (occasionally called the characteristic equation): 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">k^2+mk+n=0</script></span>
<p>
 This is a quadratic in <script type="math/tex">k</script> which has two roots <script type="math/tex">k_1 ,k_2 </script>. 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">k_1 =\frac{-m+\sqrt{m^2-4n} }{2},\quad k_2 =\frac{-m-\sqrt{m^2-4n} }{2}</script></span>
<p>
 Thus we typically have two possible solutions to the original equation <script type="math/tex">x_1=A\exp \left( {k_1 t} \right)</script> and <script type="math/tex">x_2=A\exp \left( {k_2 t} \right). </script>
</p>
<p>
We can check that the solutions are linearly independent<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000080">
<sup class="footnotemark">20</sup>
</a> by computing the Wronskian<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000081">

<p>
Hence as long as the roots of the auxilliary equation are not identical, we have a set of linearly independent solutions.

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=Ae^{k_1 t}+Be^{k_2 t}</script></span>
<p>
 is a solution of the differential equation where <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> are <b class="bfseries"><i class="itshape">any</i></b> two (very loosely: integration) constants. This is the <b class="bfseries">general</b> solution for most equations of this type. 
</p>
<p>
The two arbitrary constants <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> can only be determined by the <b class="bfseries">boundary</b> or <b class="bfseries">initial conditions</b>, as we shall see below. 
</p>
<p>
From the formula for the solution of the auxiliary equation we can see that the nature of the solution of the equation will depend on the whether <script type="math/tex">m^2>4n, \   m^2=4n,</script> or <script type="math/tex">m^2<4n</script> (in exactly the same way as the roots of a quadratic equation depend on this quantity). We now consider each of these cases in turn.

<p>
When <script type="math/tex">m^2=4n</script>, the roots <script type="math/tex">k</script> of the auxiliary equation are real and equal. Let these roots be called <script type="math/tex">k_1</script>. In this particular case, it is not possible to form a general solution with two arbitrary constants, since we could rewrite it in the following form: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=Ae^{k_1 t}+Be^{k_1 t}=\left( {A+B} \right)e^{k_1 t}=Ce^{k_1 t}</script></span>
<p>
 So that effectively there would be only one arbitrary constant. Put another way, in this case the Wronskian vanishes everywhere, since <script type="math/tex">k_1=k_2</script>. Thus we do not have the most general form (which needs two  linearly independent, solutions). 
</p>
<p>
We thus modify the guessed form of the solution to a new form<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000084">

The Wronskian of the two parts of the general solution is given by

<p>
 for finite <script type="math/tex">t</script>, and so <script type="math/tex">e^{k_1t}</script> and <script type="math/tex">te^{k_1t}</script> are linearly independent. Hence this is a general solution of the case with equal roots.

<h2 id="a0000000086">3.2 Damped Oscillations</h2>
<p>
Damped oscillations play an important role in mechanical systems. A prime example is the shock absorber in a car. This can be modelled fairly accurately by combination of a spring and a “dashpot”. 
</p>
<p>
A dashpot is a plunger in a pot of viscous liquid. A linear dashpot provides a resistive force proportional to the velocity of plunger, the constant of proportionality being <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script>. A Hookean spring with spring constant <script type="math/tex">k</script> and natural length <script type="math/tex">l</script> provides a restoring force proportional to a displacement. 
</p>
<p>
As the car of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> moves along, it encounters a bump, or variation in <script type="math/tex">z</script> in the road, the spring component compresses, and the plunger pushes into the dashpot. We want to know how the car responds to the bump so we can try to design the car to give the passengers a smooth ride. 
</p>
<p>
We will take each of the car’s four wheels to support a mass <script type="math/tex">m/4</script>. This mass will have three forces acting on it namely: gravity, the spring and the damper. We will only consider movement and forces in the vertical direction. Our coordinate system will take <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> to be in the vertical direction with the point <script type="math/tex">z=l</script> representing the position of the car when the spring is extended to its natural length.

In the upwards vertical direction, <b class="bf">N2</b> then gives  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{m}{4} \ddot{z}(t)=-k(z-l)-\lambda \dot{z}-\frac{mg}{4}</script></span>  Rearranging this we get  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{z}(t)+\frac{4\lambda }{m}\dot{z}+\frac{4k}{m}z=\frac{4kl}{m}-g = \mathrm{constant}</script></span>  This is a second order linear constant coefficient ordinary differential equation. If can be represented schematically in terms of a linear operator <script type="math/tex">{\cal L}</script> and a forcing function <script type="math/tex">f</script>.  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\cal L}z=f</script></span>  where  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\cal L} = \left(\frac{d^2}{dt^2}+\frac{4\lambda }{m}\frac{d}{dt}+\frac{4k}{m}\right)</script></span> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f = \frac{4kl}{m}-g</script></span>  We know how to solve this type of equation. We can break the solution down into two parts.  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z=z_{\rm CF}+z_{\rm PI}</script></span>  where 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000087">
<li id="a0000000088"> <p>
“CF” stands for “complementary function” and satisfies  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\cal L}z_{\rm CF}=0</script></span>
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000089"> <p>
“PI” stands for “particular integral” and satisfies  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\cal L}z_{\rm PI}=f</script></span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly we still have  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\cal L}z={\cal L}\left(z_{\rm CF}+z_{\rm PI}\right)=0+f=f.</script></span>
</p>
<p>
We solve for <script type="math/tex">z_{\rm PI}</script> by an “educated guess”. Any derivative of a constant vanishes so we can guess that a possible solution to the equation is a constant. Putting this guess into the ODE we see:  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{4k z_{\rm PI}}{m} = \frac{4kl}{m} - g \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} z_{\rm PI}=l-\frac{mg}{4k}</script></span>  This part of the solution corresponds to the position of the car if everything is stationary and the spring is compressed from its natural length due to the weight of the car. 
</p>
<p>
Next we solve for <script type="math/tex">z_{\rm CF}</script> by assuming there is a solution of the form <script type="math/tex">z=e^{\alpha t}</script> where <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> is a constant. Substitution into the homogeneous equation  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{z}(t)+\frac{4\lambda }{m}\dot{z}+\frac{4k}{m}z=0</script></span>  generates the auxiliary equation  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha ^2+\frac{4\lambda }{m}\alpha +\frac{4k}{m}=0,</script></span>  and hence <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> must be given by the solution to this quadratic  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha =-\frac{2\lambda }{m}\pm \frac{2\lambda }{m} \sqrt{1-\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}}.</script></span>
</p>
<p>
The complementary function is therefore of the form  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z_{CF}=e^{-\frac{2\lambda }{m}t}\left(Ae^{\frac{2\lambda }{m} \sqrt{1-\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}}t} +Be^{-\frac{2\lambda }{m}\sqrt{1-\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}}t}\right).</script></span>  where <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> depend on initial data <script type="math/tex">z(0), \dot{z}(0)</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the precise form of this solution will depend on whether <script type="math/tex">1-(mk)/\lambda ^2</script> is positive or negative. Hence the size of the positive quantity <script type="math/tex">mk/\lambda ^2</script> is crucial and we now discuss the different possible cases. 
</p>
<p>
If <script type="math/tex">mk/\lambda ^2>1</script> the values of <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> are complex and so the solution can be rewritten as a decaying oscillatory one.  <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z_{CF}=e^{-\frac{2\lambda }{m}t}\left(C\cos \omega t+D\sin \omega t\right), \qquad \omega =\frac{2\lambda }{m}\sqrt{\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}-1} > 0</script></span>  This situation is said to be <b class="bf">underdamped</b>: the spring is dominating the response of the shock system. Any bump in the road initiates a long tail of oscillations in the shock system. It would be best not to attempt to try to drink anything while travelling in a car with this type of shock absorbing system. Indeed such a car would fail its annual MOT test of roadworthyness.

<p>
If <script type="math/tex">mk/\lambda ^2<1</script> then both values of <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> are real and negative. Hence the the solution is the sum of two exponential decaying functions.

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z_{CF}=e^{-\frac{2\lambda }{m}t} \left(Ae^{\frac{2\lambda }{m}\sqrt{1-\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}}t} +Be^{-\frac{2\lambda }{m}\sqrt{1-\frac{mk}{\lambda ^2}}t}\right),</script></span>

If <script type="math/tex">mk/\lambda ^2=1</script> mechanically the effect of the spring and dashpot are matched. Mathematically, the solution of the auxiliary equation is degenerate and only one exponential effectively exists.

<h2 id="a0000000091">3.3 Reminder: Particular integrals and complementary functions</h2>
<p>
Let us suppose that we have found a <b class="bf">particular integral</b>, <script type="math/tex">x_ P(t)</script>, i.e., a solution that satisfies 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ P(t)\right]=f(t).</script></span>
<p>
 Due to the second order nature of the equation, we expect to have two arbitrary constants in the solution. Hence we might look for a second solution <script type="math/tex">x_ Q(t)</script> that also satisfies 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ Q(t)\right]=f(t).</script></span>
<p>
 Then, following the ideas of the solutions of the homogeneous equation, we could construct a general solution of the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=\alpha x_ P(t)+\beta x_ Q(t).</script></span>
<p>
 The only problem is, this is <b class="bf">wrong!</b>
</p>
<p>
To see why, we substitute to the proposed solution into the left-hand side of the equation: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[\alpha x_ P(t)+\beta x_ Q(t)\right]={\mathcal L}\left[\alpha x_ P(t)\right]+{\mathcal L}\left[\beta x_ Q(t)\right]=\alpha {\mathcal L}\left[ x_ P(t)\right]+\beta {\mathcal L}\left[ x_ Q(t)\right]=(\alpha +\beta )f(t).</script></span>
<p>
 This clearly does not balance the right-hand side of the equation unless the (assumed) arbitrary <script type="math/tex">\alpha +\beta </script> is always set to be unity (which they can’t be because they are arbitrary). 
</p>
<p>
Hence there is <b class="bf">one</b> and <b class="bf">only one</b> particular integral of the inhomogeneous equation, called, say <script type="math/tex">x_ P(t)</script> which satisfies the full equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ P(t)\right]=f(t).</script></span>
<p>
 We were expecting two arbitrary constants and now we have none! Where do we get them from? 
</p>
<p>
The solution comes from considering the homogeneous equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x(t)\right]=0,</script></span>
<p>
 i.e., the same left-hand side as the full inhomogeneous equation, but with <script type="math/tex">f(t)</script> replace by <script type="math/tex">0</script> on the right-hand side. We know that this “reduced” equation will have a general solution involving two arbitrary constants <script type="math/tex">A</script>, <script type="math/tex">B</script> of the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{CF}(t)=Ax_1(t)+Bx_2(t),</script></span>
<p>
 where the <script type="math/tex">x_ j(t)</script> each independent satisfy the linear homogeneous equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ j(t)\right]=0, \qquad j=1,2.</script></span>
<p>
 We call the general solution to the homogeneous equation <script type="math/tex">x_{CF}(t)</script> the <b class="bf">complementary function</b> (hence the subscript “CF” attached to it). 
</p>
<p>
Now consider what happens when we add the particular integral <script type="math/tex">x_ P(t)</script> and the complementary function <script type="math/tex">x_{CF}(t)</script> and substitute them into the left-hand side of the <b class="bf">full inhomogeneous</b> equation and use the linearity property of the operator: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ P(t)+x_{CF}(t)\right]={\mathcal L}\left[x_ P(t)\right]+{\mathcal L}\left[x_{CF}(t)\right]=f(t)+0=f(t).</script></span>
<p>
 In other words the sum of the particular integral plus the complementary function <b class="bf">also</b> satisfies the full inhomogenous equation. Since the complementary function includes two arbitrary constants, we have found the general solution of the full inhomogeneous equation: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=x_ P(t)+x_{CF}(t)=x_ P(t)+Ax_1(t)+Bx_2(t),</script></span>
<p>
 where 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\mathcal L}\left[x_ P(t)\right]=f(t), \qquad {\mathcal L}\left[x_ j(t)\right]=0, \  j=1,2.</script></span>
<p>
In general the complementary function is easy to find: you just use the same techniques as we did for solving the homogeneous equations. The difficulty arises in finding the particular integral, which must satisfy the full inhomogeneous equation. 
</p>
<p>
There are several ways of doing this. It is natural to first consider the <b class="bf">method of undetermined coefficients</b> (aka “educated guesswork”!).

<p>
This method considers the form of <script type="math/tex">f(t)</script> and then looks for a particular integral according to the following rule of thumb:

If any component of the proposed particular integrals also satisfies the homogeneous equation, then this will not be a suitable particular integral, as it will only duplicate the complementary function.

<h2 id="a0000000098">3.4 Resonance</h2>
<p>
Many oscillatory systems exhibit a phenomenon called <b class="bf">resonance</b>. This is an large (sometimes infinite) increase in the amplitude of an oscillation when the system undergoes forcing at (or near) its natural frequency. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose we have a system<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000099">
<sup class="footnotemark">24</sup>
</a>: <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{x}+\omega ^2x=\cos \omega _0t, \qquad x(0)=0, \qquad \dot{x}(0)=0.</script></span> This represents an oscillatory system with a natural frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> being forced at a frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script>, chosen by us, where for the time being, we assume that <script type="math/tex">\omega \ne \omega _0</script>. The equation could model an undamped pendulum with periodic forcing. 
</p>
<p>
We have: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000100">
<li id="a0000000101"> <p>
a complementary function <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{CF}=A\sin \omega t +B\cos \omega t</script></span>
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000102"> <p>
a particular integral <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}=C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t</script></span> so for <script type="math/tex">\omega \ne \omega _0</script> there is no duplication between the complementary function or particular integral. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 We have <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x_ P(t)& =& C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t, \\ \dot{x}_ P(t)& =& C\omega _0\cos \omega _0 t -D\omega _0\sin \omega _0 t \\ \ddot{x}_ P(t)& =& -C\omega _0^2\sin \omega _0 t -D\omega _0^2\cos \omega _0 t \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Hence substitution into the full inhomogeneous equation gives <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  -C\omega _0^2\sin \omega _0 t -D\omega _0^2\cos \omega _0 t+\omega ^2\left(C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t\right)& =& \cos \omega _0 t \\ C\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)\sin \omega _0t +D\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)\cos \omega _0t& =& \cos \omega _0 t \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> and we have <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">C=0, \qquad D=\frac{1}{\omega ^2-\omega _0^2}</script></span> Thus the particular integral is <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}=\left(\frac{1}{\omega ^2-\omega _0^2}\right)\cos \omega _0 t.</script></span>
</p>
<p>
It should be immediately obvious that if we tune the forcing frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script> to the natural frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> then the coefficient of the particular integral, and so the amplitude of the motion, diverges. Although catastrophic for the solution, this makes sense on both physical and mathematical grounds. 
</p>
<p>
On <b class="bfseries">physical</b> grounds the system is receiving a forcing input at precisely the frequency it would like to oscillate. All the energy of the forcing can be transmitted into increasing the amplitude of the natural oscillation. This is very similar to pushing a child on a swing. Push the child at the wrong frequency and the amplitude will not increase (and you’ll get hit in the face!). Push the child at the right frequency (just as the seat reaches its highest point in the swing) and the the amplitude of the swing will increase. 
</p>
<p>
On <b class="bfseries">mathematical</b> grounds when <script type="math/tex">\omega _0=\omega </script> the particular integral becomes <script type="math/tex">\cos \omega t</script>, which identical to one of the components of the complementary function. Hence if we had started with <script type="math/tex">\omega _0=\omega </script>, mathematically a particular integral of the form <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_ P(t)=t\left(C\sin \omega t+D \cos \omega t\right),</script></span> should have been used. A short exercise shows that taking this approach we obtain <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_ P(t)=\frac{t}{2\omega _0}\sin \omega t \  .</script></span> However, you can see that this particular integral will also grow in time due to the presence of the multiplicative factor of <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Hence, the amplitude of the oscillation will still grow. So regardless of whether we examine the limit of <script type="math/tex">\omega _0\rightarrow \omega </script>, or first take <script type="math/tex">\omega _0=\omega </script> and then consider <script type="math/tex">t\rightarrow \infty </script>, the amplitude will diverge. The divergence of an amplitude is often indicative of a breakdown in the assumptions underlying the actual mathematical model.

For example, if <script type="math/tex">x</script> in this equation were modelling the angle of swing of a pendulum, the differential equation would only be valid for small values of <script type="math/tex">|x| \ll 1</script>. Hence if the amplitude of the particular integral is increasing unboundedly as <script type="math/tex">\omega _0\rightarrow \omega </script>, then the assumptions that allowed us to linearise the equation from a <script type="math/tex">\sin x(t)</script> gravitational component to a simple <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> term is false and hence at that frequency it would be more appropriate to consider the full nonlinear equation <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{x}-\omega ^2\sin x(t)=\cos \omega t.</script></span> Another reason for a physical failure of the model might be because we have neglected the effect of damping (see below).

<h3 id="a0000000103">3.4.1 Beating</h3>
<p>
We continue to analyse the same situation as above, but we use it to discuss the phenomenon of <b class="bf">frequency beating</b>. 
</p>
<p>
If we now keep <script type="math/tex">\omega \ne \omega _0</script>, the full solution is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = A \sin \omega t + B\cos \omega t + {1\over \omega ^2 - \omega _0^2} \cos \omega _0 t \  ,</script></span>
<p>
 which leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(0) = B + {1\over \omega ^2 - \omega _0^2} = 0 \  ,</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot x (0) = A \omega = 0 \Rightarrow A = 0 \  .</script></span>
<p>
 That is, we have <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=x_{CF}(t)+x_ P(t)=\left(\frac{1}{\omega ^2-\omega _0^2}\right)\left(\cos \omega _0 t-\cos \omega t\right).</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Subtracting the angle addition formulae <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\cos (A \pm B)=\cos A\cos B \mp \sin A\sin B,</script></span> from one another, we have <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2\sin A \sin B= \cos (A-B) -\cos (A+B).</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Hence, seting <script type="math/tex">A-B=\omega _0</script> and <script type="math/tex">A+B=\omega </script>, the full solution can be written as <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=\left(\frac{2}{\omega ^2-\omega _0^2}\right)\sin \left[\left(\frac{\omega +\omega _0}{2}\right)t\right]\sin \left[\left(\frac{\omega -\omega _0}{2}\right)t\right].</script></span>

<p>
The structure of this extremely informative. It is an amplitude, multiplied by two sines. If <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> is approximately (but not exactly) equal to <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script>, the first sine oscillates with a high frequency, being the mean of <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> and <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script>. The second sine oscillates at a lower frequency being the half the difference of <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> and <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script>. The effect can be seen graphically:

The amplitude higher frequency component is modulated by the lower frequency component. This is a phenomenon known as <b class="bf">beating</b>. It occurs, for example, when two musical instruments, violins say, that are almost, but not quite in tune.

<h3 id="a0000000104">3.4.2 Near resonance and damping.</h3>
<p>
The system we studied above had no damping <script type="math/tex">\dot{x}(t)</script> term. Damping terms have the effect of “smearing out” the resonance. To see this we study the equation <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{x}+\lambda \dot{x} +\omega ^2 x = \cos \omega _0 t</script></span> where <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> is a positive damping constant such that <script type="math/tex">\lambda ^2<4\omega ^2</script> and the forcing frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script> is a parameter that can be changes to cycle through the value of the natural frequency of the undamped system <script type="math/tex">\omega </script>. 
</p>
<p>
We now have: a complementary function <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{CF}=e^{-\lambda t/2}\left(A\cos \sigma t +B\sin \sigma t\right)</script></span> where <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma =\sqrt{4\omega ^2-\lambda ^2}/2>0.</script></span> Clearly, this is a damped (actually underdamped) oscillatory motion, and so decreases in magnitude with time, whatever the forcing frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script> or (finite) initial conditions (i.e., the (finite) values of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>). This type of motion is thus said to be <b class="bf">transient</b>: eventually the system will increasingly be increasingly less dominated by any component that corresponds to its <b class="bf">natural</b> frequency and will become increasingly dominated by motion at the <b class="bf">forced</b> frequency. Thus we won’t bother finding <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> and pass on to the particular integral. 
</p>
<p>
Due to the presence of <script type="math/tex">e^{-\lambda t/2}</script> prefactor in the complementary function, the particular integral which takes the form <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}=C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t</script></span> now has no duplication with the complementary function whether <script type="math/tex">\omega _0=\omega </script> or not. The linear growth is no longer apparent. 
</p>
<p>
We have (yet again) <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x_ P(t)& =& C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t, \\ \dot{x}_ P(t)& =& C\omega _0\cos \omega _0 t -D\omega _0\sin \omega _0 t \\ \ddot{x}_ P(t)& =& -C\omega _0^2\sin \omega _0 t -D\omega _0^2\cos \omega _0 t \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Hence substitution into the full inhomogeneous equation gives 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  -C\omega _0^2\sin \omega _0 t -D\omega _0^2\cos \omega _0 t+\lambda \left(C\omega _0\cos \omega _0 t -D\omega _0\sin \omega _0 t \right)+\\ +\omega ^2\left(C\sin \omega _0 t +D\cos \omega _0 t\right)& =& \cos \omega _0 t \\ \left\{ C\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)-\lambda D \omega _0\right\} \sin \omega _0t +\left\{ D\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)+\lambda C \omega _0\right\} \cos \omega _0t& =& \cos \omega _0 t \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 and we have <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">C\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)-\lambda D \omega _0=0, \qquad D\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)+\lambda C \omega _0=1</script></span> which can be solved simultaneously to give <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">C=\frac{\lambda \omega _0}{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)^2+\left(\lambda \omega _0\right)^2} \qquad D=\frac{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)}{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)^2+\left(\lambda \omega _0\right)^2}</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Thus the particular integral is <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}=\frac{\lambda \omega _0}{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)^2+\left(\lambda \omega _0\right)^2}\sin \omega _0 t+\frac{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)}{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)^2+\left(\lambda \omega _0\right)^2}\cos \omega _0t</script></span> This can be put into the form of just a single, phase lagged, oscillatory term using the standard addition formulae for sine and cosine: <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*} C\sin \omega _0t+D\cos \omega _0t& =& \sqrt{C^2+D^2}\left(\underbrace{\frac{C}{\sqrt{C^2+D^2}}}_{=\cos \phi }\sin \omega _0t+\underbrace{\frac{D}{\sqrt{C^2+D^2}}}_{=\sin \phi }\cos \omega _0t\right). \\ \Rightarrow x_ P(t)& =&  \sqrt{C^2+D^2}\sin (\omega _0 t +\phi ), \\ \tan \phi & =& \frac{D}{C}. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
</p>
<p>
Using this approach we see that the amplitude of the oscillation is <script type="math/tex">R(\omega _0)=\sqrt{C^2+D^2}</script>. For our <script type="math/tex">C</script> and <script type="math/tex">D</script> above this is <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R(\omega _0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)^2+\left(\lambda \omega _0\right)^2}}, \qquad \tan \phi = \frac{\left(\omega ^2-\omega _0^2\right)}{\lambda \omega }.</script></span>
</p>
<p>
If we take the driving amplitude to be 1, the ratio of the response to the forcing is <script type="math/tex">R(\omega _0)</script>. A graph of this as a function of <script type="math/tex">\omega _0</script> is plotted below for different values of <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script>. Note that at resonance <script type="math/tex">\omega _0=\omega </script>, the response climbs rapidly in amplitude, but is not infinite. The size of the response at resonance increases as the damping <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> decreases.

Clearly the damping in the system means avoids a divergence in the response. This is a more physically realistic model of forced oscillatory systems. 
</p>
<p>
This is a simple model of the mechanism that is responsible for the serious problems that arose with the Millennium footbridge in London. Soon after it was opened to foot passengers in June 2000, it became apparent that the bridge was undergoing a resonance swaying due to the frequency of footfalls. Extra masses and dampers had to be added to change the position and amplitude of the resonance. A more catastrophic example of resonance is the Tacoma bridge collapse of 1940. There a resonance of the bridge was excited by abnormal wind conditions. This resonance built up and ultimately led to the collapse of the bridge. Resonance is still an extremely important consideration in engineering construction (be it civil or electrical).

<h2 id="a0000000105">3.5 Going further: The Wronskian</h2>
<p>
So far we have focussed on second order constant equations. The are nice—because we can solve them–but they do not (necessarily) represent reality. In order to go further, we need to develop a bit more computational technology. As this machinery can be applied to more general problems, we take as our starting point an equation of form <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+p(t)\frac{dx}{dt}+q(t)x(t)=r(t),</script></span> where <script type="math/tex">p, q</script> and <script type="math/tex">r</script> are known functions of <script type="math/tex">t</script>. We also need initial data: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(0) = x_0 \qquad \dot x(0) = u_0\  .</script></span>
<p>
We first consider the <b class="bf">homogeneous</b> case where <script type="math/tex">r(t)=0</script>: <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+p(t)\frac{dx}{dt}+q(t)x(t)=0.</script></span> and pose two questions we have so far (conveniently) avoided. How many solutions does this equation have? How do we know that these solutions are “independent”? 
</p>
<p>
The first step towards answering these questions involves noting that, since the equation is linear, we can add solutions to get solutions. In essence, a linear combination of solutions is also a solution. This is easy to prove, bit it does not take us very far. We may also note that, since we have a second order equation, we need to “integrate” twice which means that we would expect to have two integration constants floating around. This suggests that (perhaps) we should expect that there are two solutions. This turns out to be correct, but how do we prove this? 
</p>
<p>
Suppose we start by assuming that there is a single solution, <script type="math/tex">x_1(t)</script>, corresponding to given initial data at (say) <script type="math/tex">t=t_0</script>. Setting <script type="math/tex">x(t)=\alpha x_1(t)</script> with <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> we then require <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \alpha x_1(t_0)& =& x_0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \alpha =x_0/x_1(t_0)\\ \alpha \dot{x}_1(t_0)& =& u_0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \alpha =u_0/\dot{x}_1(t_0) \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> and it is easy to see that we cannot (in general) satisfy both equations with a single value of <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script>. Hence, a single solution is not sufficient to provide a unique solution to the second order system of the equation plus two initial conditions. 
</p>
<p>
What happens if we consider two solutions, <script type="math/tex">x_1(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">x_2(t)</script>? Now set <script type="math/tex">x(t)=\alpha x_1(t)+\beta x_2(t)</script> with <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> and <script type="math/tex">\beta </script> constants. Then the initial conditions require <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \alpha x_1(t_0)+\beta x_2(t_0)& =& x_0 \\ \alpha \dot{x}_1(t_0)+\beta \dot{x}_2(t_0)& =& u_0 \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> This can be written as a matrix equation <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left(\begin{array}{cc}x_1(t_0) &  x_2(t_0) \\ \dot{x}_1(t_0) &  \dot{x}_2(t_0)\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha \\ \beta \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}x_0 \\ u_0\end{array}\right)</script></span> We see that, in order that solutions <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> and <script type="math/tex">\beta </script> exist, we require the existence of the inverse of the <script type="math/tex">2\times 2</script> matrix containing the initial data, <script type="math/tex">x_ i(t_0)</script>. 
</p>
<p>
From standard matrix theory (=linear algebra!), we know that the inverse exists if the determinant of the square matrix is non-zero, i.e., 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(t_0) &  x_2(t_0) \\ \dot{x}_1(t_0) &  \dot{x}_2(t_0)\end{array}\right|\ne 0.</script></span>
<p>
 We learn that two solutions will be sufficient, as long as this condition is satisfied. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose that this determinant were actually zero. What would that mean? If we evaluate it explicitly we obtain<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000106">
<sup class="footnotemark">25</sup>
</a>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1(t_0)\dot{x}_2(t_0)-\dot{x}_1(t_0)x_2(t_0)=0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{x_1(t_0)}{x_2(t_0)}=\frac{\dot{x}_1(t_0)}{\dot{x}_2(t_0)}=c, \  {\rm say}.</script></span>
<p>
 Hence if the determinant were to vanish, we would have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1(t_0)=cx_2(t_0), \qquad \dot{x}_1(t_0)=c\dot{x}_2(t_0)</script></span>
<p>
 which implies that the two solutions <script type="math/tex">x_1(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">x_2(t)</script> are proportional: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1(t)=cx_2(t).</script></span>
<p>
Suppose instead that there are three fundamental solutions. Set <script type="math/tex">x(t)=\alpha x_1(t)+\beta x_2(t)+\gamma x_3(t)</script> where <script type="math/tex">x_3(t)\not \equiv 0</script> and <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script>, <script type="math/tex">\beta </script>, <script type="math/tex">\gamma </script> constants to be found by satisfaction of the initial conditions. Then the initial conditions require the following equations to be satisfied: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \alpha x_1(t_0)+\beta x_2(t_0)+\gamma x_3(t_0)& =& x_0 \\ \alpha \dot{x}_1(t_0)+\beta \dot{x}_2(t_0)+\gamma \dot{x}_3(t_0)& =& u_0 \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 This is an <b class="bf">underdetermined</b> system with 3 unknowns, but only 2 equations. Hence it is impossible to determine unique values of <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script>, <script type="math/tex">\beta </script> and <script type="math/tex">\gamma </script>—we cannot have a unique solution. A similar argument applies when we have more than three candidate fundamental solutions. 
</p>
<p>
We have learned something very important. A necessary and sufficient condition to find the complete solution of a second order homogenous linear ordinary differential equation with initial conditions is that we find two solutions <script type="math/tex">x_1(t)</script>, <script type="math/tex">x_2(t)</script> such that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(t_0) &  x_2(t_0) \\ \dot{x}_1(t_0) &  \dot{x}_2(t_0)\end{array}\right|\ne 0.</script></span>
<p>
 Then the general solution of the differential equation is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=\alpha x_1(t)+\beta x_2(t)</script></span>
<p>
 with <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> and <script type="math/tex">\beta </script> determined by the initial conditions.

Consider the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator

<p>
 for which we know the solutions 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1(t)=\cos t, \qquad x_2(t)=\sin t.</script></span>

 Then we have

<p>
 Hence we deduce that <script type="math/tex">\cos t</script> and <script type="math/tex">\sin t</script> are linearly independent, i.e., it is not possible to find non-zero constants <script type="math/tex">c_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">c_2</script> such that <script type="math/tex">c_1 \cos t + c_2 \sin t =0</script> on an interval of <script type="math/tex">t</script>. (Of course we can find these constants so that <script type="math/tex">c_1 \cos t + c_2 \sin t =0</script> at a point, but linear dependence would require this expression to vanish over a range of values of <script type="math/tex">t</script>.)

<h2 id="a0000000107">3.6 General force terms: Variation of parameters</h2>
<p>
Finally, let us go a step further in the direction of more realistic situations, e.g. where the involved forces do not lend themselves to “guessing” suitable particular integrals. This illustrates an important method, which “happens” to include our recent friend, the Wronskian. The key point is that it provides a systematic way to obtain a particular integral without any form of guesswork. The method of <b class="bf">variation of parameters</b> provides just such a method. It can be applied whether the coefficients in the linear equation are constant or functions of the independent variable. 
</p>
<p>
Let us start from a linear second order equation of form: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)+p(t)x’(t)+q(t)x(t)=r(t),</script></span>
<p>
 and assume that we have found a complementary function 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{CF}(t)=\alpha x_1(t)+\beta x_2(t)</script></span>
<p>
 which satisfies the homogeneous equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)+p(t)x’(t)+q(t)x(t)=0.</script></span>
<p>
 Suppose we now look for a particular integral of the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}(t)=v_1(t)x_1(t)+v_2(t)x_2(t),</script></span>
<p>
 where the <script type="math/tex">x_ i(t)</script> are the complementary functions above and <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script> are functions to be determined. 
</p>
<p>
Note that, if <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script> were constants then this would have an identical form to the complementary function, which would not be allowed. We therefore assume that <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script> are <b class="bf">not</b> constants and that they will turn out to be such that the complementary function is linearly independent of the particular integral. 
</p>
<p>
Let us further suppose that the following two conditions hold (we will soon see why these are useful): 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  v’_1(t)x_1(t)+v’_2(t)x_2(t)& =& 0 \\ v’_1(t)x’_1(t)+v’_2(t)x’_2(t)& =& r(t) \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 We can make these two assumptions, since the two <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script> are, as yet, undetermined. 
</p>
<p>
To find the <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script> we must differentiate <script type="math/tex">x_{P}(t)</script> and substitute it into the inhomogeneous equation. We then have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x’_{P}(t)=\underbrace{v'_1(t)x_1(t)+v'_2(t)x_2(t)}_{=0 \   {\rm by \  assumption}}+v_1(t)x’_1(t)+v_2(t)x’_2(t)=v_1(t)x’_1(t)+v_2(t)x’_2(t)</script></span>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”_{P}(t)=v_1(t)x”_1(t)+v_2(t)x”_2(t)+\underbrace{v'_1(t)x'_1(t)+v'_2(t)x'_2(t)}_{=r(t) \   {\rm by \  assumption}}=v_1(t)x”_1(t)+v_2(t)x”_2(t)+r(t)</script></span>
<p>
Substitution thus gives 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  {\rm LHS}& =& x”_ P+p(t)x’_ P+q(t)x_ P(t) \\ & =& \left\{ v_1(t)x”_1(t)+v_2(t)x”_2(t)+r(t)\right\} +p(t)\left\{ v_1(t)x’_1(t)+v_2(t)x’_2(t)\right\} +q(t)x_ P(t) \\ & =& v_1(t)\underbrace{\left\{ x''_1(t)+p(t)x'_1(t)+q(t)x_1(t)\right\} }_{=0}+v_2(t)\underbrace{\left\{ x''_2(t)+p(t)x'_2(t)+q(t)x_2(t)\right\} }_{=0}+r(t) \\ & =&  r(t) = {\rm RHS} \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
So what? Well... we have just shown that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}(t)=v_1(t)x_1(t)+v_2(t)x_2(t)</script></span>
<p>
 is the particular integral of 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)+p(t)x’(t)+q(t)x(t)=r(t)</script></span>
<p>
 provided that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”_ i(t)+p(t)x’_ i(t)+q(t)x_ i(t)=0, \qquad i=1,2</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  v’_1(t)x_1(t)+v’_2(t)x_2(t)& =& 0 \\ v’_1(t)x’_1(t)+v’_2(t)x’_2(t)& =& r(t). \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 How does this help to find the <script type="math/tex">v_ i(t)</script>? We have two simultaneous equations for <script type="math/tex">v'_ i(t)</script>. These can be rewritten as a matrix equation: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left(\begin{array}{cc}x_1(t) &  x_2(t) \\ x’_1(t) &  x’_2(t)\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}v’_1(t) \\ v’_2(t)\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}0 \\ r(t)\end{array}\right)</script></span>
<p>
 which can be solved by inverting the coefficient matrix to give 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left(\begin{array}{c}v’_1(t) \\ v’_2(t)\end{array}\right)=\frac{\left(\begin{array}{cc}x’_2(t) &  -x_2(t) \\ -x’_1(t) &  x_1(t)\end{array}\right)}{\left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(t) &  x_2(t) \\ x’_1(t) &  x’_2(t)\end{array}\right|}\left(\begin{array}{c}0 \\ r(t)\end{array}\right)=\frac{r(t)}{W[x_1(t),x_2(t)]}\left(\begin{array}{c}-x_2(t) \\ x_1(t)\end{array}\right)</script></span>
<p>
 where we have recognised <script type="math/tex">W[x_1(t),x_2(t)]</script> as the Wronskian of <script type="math/tex">x_1(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">x_2(t)</script>. Thus we have two equations to solve 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v’_1(t)=-\frac{x_2(t)r(t)}{W[x_1(t),x_2(t)]}, \qquad v’_2(t)=\frac{x_1(t)r(t)}{W[x_1(t),x_2(t)]}</script></span>
<p>
 These can be integrated immediately with respect to <script type="math/tex">t</script> to give the solutions 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_1(t)=-\int ^ t\frac{x_2(\zeta )r(\zeta )}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}d \zeta \qquad v_2(t)=\int ^ t\frac{x_1(\zeta )r(\zeta )}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}d\zeta</script></span>
<p>
At the end of the day, we find that the particular integral is given by 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x_{P}(t)& =& v_1(t)x_1(t)+v_2(t)x_2(t) \\ & =& -x_1(t)\int ^ t\frac{x_2(\zeta )r(\zeta )}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}d \zeta +x_2(t)\int ^ t\frac{x_1(\zeta )r(\zeta )}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}d\zeta \\ \Rightarrow x_{P}(t)& =& \int ^ t\frac{\left\{ x_2(t)x_1(\zeta )-x_1(t)x_2(\zeta )\right\} r(\zeta )}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}d\zeta \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 The final formula can be conveniently remembered as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{P}(t)=\int ^ t\frac{\left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(\zeta ) &  x_2(\zeta ) \\ x_1(t) &  x_2(t)\end{array}\right|}{W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]}r(\zeta )d\zeta</script></span>

<li id="a0000000109"> <p>
Note that the lower limit is not specified. This is because any arbitrary change in the lower limit just generates the complementary function, which adds nothing to the particular integral. Hence it is possible to ignore the arbitrary constant of integration. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000110"> <p>
Note that the coefficients in the inhomogeneous equation <script type="math/tex">p(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">q(t)</script> were not assumed to be constants. Hence this formula is valid for particular integrals of more than just inhomogeneous equations of differential equations with constant coefficients. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000111"> <p>
An analogous formula can be derived for <script type="math/tex">n^{\rm th}</script> order equations, but we will not consider this here. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]A simple case 
</p>
<p>
Consider the following linear, inhomogeneous, second order, constant-coefficient equation: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{x}-\dot{x}-2x=e^{3t}</script></span>
<p>
 for which it is easy to see that the particular integral has the form <script type="math/tex">Ae^{3t}</script> and we can substitute in to find <script type="math/tex">A</script>. Now let us instead use variation of parameters to systematically find the particular integral <b class="bf">without guessing</b>. 
</p>
<p>
The complementary function is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=Ae^{-t}+Be^{2t} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x_1(t)=e^{-t}, x_2(t)=e^{2t}</script></span>
<p>
The inhomogeneous term on the right-hand side is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">r(t)=e^{3t}.</script></span>
<p>
The Wronskian is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]= \left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(\zeta ) &  x_2(\zeta ) \\ \dot{x}_1(\zeta ) &  \dot{x}_2(\zeta )\end{array}\right|=\left|\begin{array}{cc}e^{-\zeta } &  e^{2\zeta } \\ -e^{-\zeta } &  2e^{2\zeta }\end{array}\right|=3e^{\zeta }</script></span>
<p>
Thus the particular integral is given by: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x_{P}(t)& =& \int ^ t\frac{\left|\begin{array}{cc}e^{-\zeta } &  e^{2\zeta } \\ e^{-t} &  e^{2t}\end{array}\right|}{3e^{\zeta }}e^{3\zeta }d\zeta \\ & =& \frac{1}{3}\int ^ t\left(e^{2t-\zeta }-e^{2\zeta -t}\right) e^{2\zeta }d\zeta \\ & =&  \frac{1}{3}\int ^ t\left(e^{2t+\zeta }-e^{4\zeta -t}\right) d\zeta \\ & =& \frac{1}{3}e^{2t}\int ^ t e^{\zeta } d\zeta -\frac{1}{3}e^{-t}\int ^ te^{4\zeta } d\zeta \\ & =& \frac{1}{3}e^{2t+t} -\frac{1}{12}e^{-t+4t} \\ & =& \frac{1}{4}e^{3t}, \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 where it is worth noting that we ignored the constants of integration in the integral. 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]A more complicated situation 
</p>
<p>
The variation of parameters is a powerful tool for finding the particular integral of inhomogeneous equations where it is not easy to guess its form from the inhomogeneity on the right-hand side. As an example of this, we seek the particular integral of the inhomogeneous equation: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{x}-2\dot{x}+x=\frac{e^ t}{t^2+1}.</script></span>
<p>
The complementary function is given in straightforward manner by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=(A+Bt)e^ t \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x_1(t)=e^{t}, x_2(t)=te^{t}</script></span>
<p>
The inhomogeneous term on the RHS is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">r(t)=\frac{e^ t}{t^2+1},</script></span>
<p>
 which is clearly like nothing we have studied before. Don’t panic! Just use the formula from variation of parameters. 
</p>
<p>
The Wronskian is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">W[x_1(\zeta ),x_2(\zeta )]= \left|\begin{array}{cc}x_1(\zeta ) &  x_2(\zeta ) \\ \dot{x}_1(\zeta ) &  \dot{x}_2(\zeta )\end{array}\right|=\left|\begin{array}{cc}e^{\zeta } &  \zeta e^{\zeta } \\ e^{\zeta } &  (1+\zeta )e^{\zeta }\end{array}\right|=e^{2\zeta }</script></span>
<p>
Thus the particular integral is given by: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  x_{P}(t)& =& \int ^ t\frac{\left|\begin{array}{cc}e^{\zeta } &  \zeta e^{\zeta } \\ e^{t} &  te^{t}\end{array}\right|}{e^{2\zeta }}\left(\frac{e^\zeta }{\zeta ^2+1}\right)d\zeta \\ & =& \int ^ t\left(te^{t+\zeta }-\zeta e^{\zeta +t}\right) \left(\frac{e^{-\zeta }}{\zeta ^2+1}\right)d\zeta \\ & =& \int ^ t \frac{\left(te^{t}-\zeta e^{t}\right)}{\zeta ^2+1}d\zeta \\ & =& te^{t}\int ^ t \frac{d\zeta }{\zeta ^2+1}d\zeta - e^{t}\int ^ t \frac{\zeta }{\zeta ^2+1}d\zeta \\ & =& te^{t}\arctan t - \frac{1}{2}e^ t \log | t^2+1| \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Which clearly looks nothing like the original right-hand side: without the formula from the variation of parameters we would not not have realistically been able to guess the form of the PI! 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the general solution of the above equation is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=x_{CF}+x_{P}=(A+Bt)e^ t+te^{t}\arctan t - \frac{1}{2}e^ t \log | t^2+1|.</script></span>

<h2 id="a0000000112">3.7 Eigenvalues and boundary value problems (vibrating strings)</h2>
<p>
So far we have assumed that the problem we consider involves only initial conditions, which serve to fix the integration constants in the problem and/or the relation between linearly independent solutions at the initial time. There is, however, an important alternative to this, where the solution is instead constrained by set boundary conditions. This changes the nature of the problem—instead of considering the evolution of the system we would typically end up discussing eigenvalues and characteristic solutions which help us understand the behaviour. We will not go very far in this direction, but it is very important that we understand the ideas involved as the lay the foundation for the standard method of solving linear <b class="bfseries">partial differential equations</b>. 
</p>
<p>
As a step in this direction—aimed at illustrating the principle and the fact that the specification of boundary data may lead to either no solutions or an infinite number of them—let us consider <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)+p(t)x’(t)+\lambda q(t)x(t)=0, \qquad x(a)=0,\qquad x(b)=0.</script></span> The key point is that we will treat <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> as a parameter, which turns out to determine the existence and type of solutions. Intuitively, thinking of this as an initially unspecified parameter, we can “tune” <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> (exactly as in tuning the frequency of a violin string, say) to select the type of solution we want. 
</p>
<p>
Typically a solution satisfying the boundary conditions will exist for only certain values of <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script>. Such problems are called <b class="bf">eigenvalue problems</b> and <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> is the <b class="bf">eigenvalue</b><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000113">
<sup class="footnotemark">26</sup>
</a>. The solution of the equation+boundary value problem corresponding to a particular value of <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> is called the <b class="bf">eigenfunction</b>.

<p>
 let us figure out which values of <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> lead to non-trivial solutions? We have to consider all (real) possibilities. 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000116">
<li id="a0000000117"> <p>
Suppose we have <script type="math/tex">\lambda =0</script>: 
</p>
<p>
If <script type="math/tex">\lambda =0</script>, the equation becomes <script type="math/tex">x''(t)=0</script>, with a general solution 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=At+B,</script></span>
<p>
 Substitution into the endpoint conditions gives <script type="math/tex">A=B=0</script>. Hence the only solution when <script type="math/tex">\lambda =0</script> is the trivial one <script type="math/tex">x(t)=0</script>. Such static solutions are often rejected in modelling situations as being too boring, or irrelevant. Hence <script type="math/tex">\lambda =0</script> is rejected as an eigenvalue. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000118"> <p>
If, instead, the parameter is negative, <script type="math/tex">\lambda <0=-\alpha ^2</script>: 
</p>
<p>
Now the equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)-\alpha ^2 x(t)=0</script></span>
<p>
 has a general solution 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=A\cosh \alpha t+B\sinh \alpha t.</script></span>
<p>
 Substitution into the left endpoint conditions gives: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(0)=A\cosh 0+B\sinh 0 =A =0.</script></span>
<p>
 Substitution into the right endpoint conditions gives: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(L)=A\cosh \alpha L+B\sinh \alpha L =B\sinh \alpha L =0.</script></span>
<p>
 Now <script type="math/tex">\sinh \alpha L</script> can only vanish when <script type="math/tex">\alpha L=0</script>. Hence we deduce that <script type="math/tex">B=0</script>. Again the only solution when <script type="math/tex">\lambda <0</script> is the trivial one <script type="math/tex">x(t)=0</script>. Hence there are no eigenvalues when <script type="math/tex">\lambda <0</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000119"> <p>
Finally, the parameter may be positive, <script type="math/tex">\lambda >0=+\alpha ^2</script>: 
</p>
<p>
The equation is now 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x”(t)+\alpha ^2 x(t)=0</script></span>
<p>
 with a general solution 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=A\cos \alpha t+B\sin \alpha t.</script></span>
<p>
 Substitution into the left endpoint conditions gives: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(0)=A\cos 0+B\sin 0 =A =0.</script></span>
<p>
 Substitution into the right endpoint conditions gives: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(L)=A\cos \alpha L+B\sin \alpha L =B\sin \alpha L =0.</script></span>
<p>
 Clearly <script type="math/tex">B\sin \alpha L</script> can vanish when <script type="math/tex">B=0</script>. This would again lead to a trivial solution. However <script type="math/tex">B\sin \alpha L</script> can also vanish if we tune <script type="math/tex">\lambda </script> so that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha L=n\pi , \qquad n\in {\mathbb N} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \alpha =\frac{n\pi }{L} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \lambda \equiv \lambda _ n=\left(\frac{n\pi }{L}\right)^2.</script></span>
<p>
 Hence for a set of discrete eigenvalues <script type="math/tex">\lambda _ n</script>, we can find eigenfunctions 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x(t)=B\sin \lambda _ n t=B_ n\sin \frac{n\pi t}{L}</script></span>
<p>
 that satisfy the equation and the boundary conditions. Note that <script type="math/tex">B</script> is still undetermined. Any possible finite value of <script type="math/tex">B</script> will do, and it could vary between the <script type="math/tex">\lambda _ n</script>. As we shall see in the example below, additional information is often used to determine which values of <script type="math/tex">B_ n</script> are appropriate.

The problem is easily solved because it can be turned into a second-order linear constant-coefficient equation by the change of variables: <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">z=\ln t \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad t=e^ z.</script></span></span> Using the chain rule, we have <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{dx}{dt}& =& \frac{dx}{dz}\frac{dz}{dt}=\frac{1}{t}\frac{dx}{dz}=e^{-z}\frac{dx}{dz} \\ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}& =& \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)=\frac{d}{dt}\left(e^{-z}\frac{dx}{dz}\right) = e^{-z}\frac{d}{dz}\left(e^{-z}\frac{dx}{dz}\right)=e^{-2z}\frac{d^2x}{dz^2}-e^{-2z}\frac{dx}{dz}. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> Substitution of these results into the Euler equation gives <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  a_2e^{2z}\left(e^{-2z}\frac{d^2x}{dz^2}-e^{-2z}\frac{dx}{dz}\right)+a_1e^{z}\left(e^{-z}\frac{dx}{dz}\right)+a_0x& =& 0, \\ a_2\frac{d^2x}{dz^2}+(a_1-a_2)\frac{dx}{dz}+a_0x& =& 0 \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> This is (obviously) a homogeneous second-order constant-coefficient equation and so can be solved by the usual method, for <script type="math/tex">x</script> as a function of <script type="math/tex">z</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">x</script> can be written in terms of <script type="math/tex">t</script> by using the substitution <script type="math/tex">z=\ln t</script>. 
</p>
<p>
In practice, note that (at least for distinct roots) the solutions of the transformed equation will take the form <script type="math/tex">e^{k_ i z}</script>. Hence after transforming back to the original variables <script type="math/tex">x</script>, then the solutions take the form <script type="math/tex">t^{k_ i}</script>. Hence it is possible to attack Euler equations by a direct substitution of solutions of the form <script type="math/tex">t^ k</script> and solving the indicial equation (=auxiliary equations) for <script type="math/tex">k</script>.

 [width=%+10mm]Stellar oscillations 
</p>
<p>
A typical situation where Euler equations arise is in <em>astero-seismology</em> (the oscillations of stars)—perhaps ironically, involving the Euler equations from fluid dynamics. The relevant equation relates to the dependence on the radial coordinate, which we will call <script type="math/tex">t</script> in order to stay close to the previous description. One arrives at an ordinary differential equation by the method of separation of variables (which you will find out a lot more about next year). This equation can be written 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t^2 x” + 2t x’ - l(l+1) x = 0</script></span>
<p>
 with <script type="math/tex">l\ge 0</script> and integer. We want the solution to be i) regular at the centre, <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>, and ii) match smoothly to a solution in the star’s exterior. We will ignore the second of these conditions for now. 
</p>
<p>
Trying a power-law solution, <script type="math/tex">x=t^\alpha </script>, we get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha (\alpha -1) t^2 \times t^{\alpha -2} + 2 \alpha t\times t^{\alpha -1} - l(l+1) t^\alpha = 0</script></span>
<p>
 or, dividing through by the common factor <script type="math/tex">t^\alpha </script>; 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha (\alpha -1) + 2\alpha - l(l+1) = 0</script></span>
<p>
 or 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha ^2 + \alpha - l(l+1) = 0 \Longrightarrow \alpha = -{1\over 2} \pm \sqrt{{1\over 4} + l(l+1) } = -{1\over 2} \pm \left( l+ {1\over 2} \right)</script></span>
<p>
 We have two options. Either <script type="math/tex">\alpha = l</script>, which means that the solution behaves like <script type="math/tex">t^ l</script>. That is, it satisfies the boundary condition at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>. The other option is <script type="math/tex">\alpha = -l - 1</script> and a solution that behaves as <script type="math/tex">t^{-l-1}</script>, which diverges as <script type="math/tex">t\to 0</script> and therefore must be discarded.

In general, kinematics is concerned with the description of moving bodies, without considering how the motion is produced. This typically involves the motion in terms of

<p>
 For any given force, the motion is then determines from Newton’s second law (<b class="bf">N2</b>). We have seen aspects of this already. Now we are going to take a closer look at the role of the observer. In particular, we are going to touch upon aspects relating to Newton’s first law, which brings in the concept of an <em>inertial frame</em>. We know that, in a coordinate system in which there is no force acting on a body, it does not accelerate (relative to these coordinates). Let us now add the desire that different observers should infer the same physics. In order for that to be the case, the velocity of the observer (or the experimental device) must not impact on the dynamics. This gives us a hint of what we are after. In order to make the idea precise, it helps if we understand how measurements are affected by relative motion.

<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000129">4.1 Frames of Reference</h2>
<p>
An event takes place at a point in space at a give time. For example, Man landed on the Moon on July 16th 1969 at the Sea of Tranquility; JFK was assassinated on 26th November 1963 in Dallas, Texas. 
</p>
<p>
We can all agree that these specific events happened<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000130">
<sup class="footnotemark">29</sup>
</a>, but we may disagree on the exact coordinate location or time. We may not have synchronised our clocks and we may be using different rulers. 
</p>
<p>
Events can be characterised both in time and space and for this we need a <b class="bf">reference frame</b>, which is a set of spatial coordinates plus a time coordinate. In general the motion of a body is also described by reference to a set of axes, for example the Cartesian coordinate system with a specific origin. Sometimes a set of axes, called a <b class="bf">frame</b> may itself be moving<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000131">
<sup class="footnotemark">30</sup>
</a> and different observers may choose different points for their origin. 
</p>
<p>
For example, someone sitting in a train may naturally choose to centre his (Cartesian) coordinate description of the world on his seat. Someone waiting on the platform as the train passes through the station would more likely centre her (Cartesian) coordinate description of the world on her position on the platform. If the passenger on the train throws an apple into the air as the train passes through the station, he will describe its motion according to his set of coordinates which travel with the train. The trajectory of the apple will look quite different to the person waiting on the platform as will her description of the trajectory in terms of the platform coordinates. How can we reconcile the two descriptions? 
</p>
<p>
To begin to do this we need to define the concept of an inertial frame of reference. 
</p>
<p>
An <b class="bf">inertial frame of reference</b> is <span style="color:#000000">a set of coordinate axes in which an isolated body under no forces (i.e., external influence) travels with constant velocity.</span>
</p>
<p>
Experiment demonstrates that a frame fixed relative to the sun is inertial for all macroscopic practical purposes. However, a frame which rotates relative to another frame is <b class="bf">not</b> inertial because any motion in a curve must produce an acceleration and hence involves a non-constant velocity. Thus technically speaking a frame fixed in a laboratory on the surface of the rotating earth is <b class="bf">not</b> inertial, since the laboratory itself is rotating. However for most practical purposes the earth is spinning so slowly that the rotational complications are unimportant (the anticlockwise spinning of the water down the plug-hole in the northern hemisphere is a myth!). However for situations involving large distances or timescales, such as meteorology or intercontinental ballistic missiles, the effects of rotation do introduce additional external influences that must be taken into account.

Basically, in what follows we are always working with approximations.

<p>
 This is the equation that links the relative velocities of the point as observed in each frame, when the two frames are moving with respect to each other. We see that velocities add, just as we expect from our everyday intuition. 
</p>
<p>
Relative velocities are confusing. However the confusion can often be minimised by drawing a diagram<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000138">
<sup class="footnotemark">33</sup>
</a>. Also, the following alternative notation might make things clearer. The crucial equation we use is of the simple form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}_{AC} = \textcolor{black}{ {\vec v}_{AB} + {\vec v}_{BC} }</script></span>
<p>
 In words, the velocity of <script type="math/tex">A</script> relative to <script type="math/tex">C</script> is equal to the sum of the velocity of <script type="math/tex">A</script> relative to <script type="math/tex">B</script>, plus the velocity of <script type="math/tex">B</script> relative to <script type="math/tex">C</script>. This follows from the equation relating displacement vectors: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec{AC} = \textcolor{black}{ \vec{AB} + \vec{BC} }</script></span>

</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}_{AC} = \textcolor{black}{ {\vec r_{AB}} + {\vec r_{BC}} }</script></span>
<p>
 The equation for relative velocities is simply the time derivative of these equations. 
</p>
<p>
If <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}_{S'S}</script> is a constant=<script type="math/tex">{\vec V}</script>, say then <script type="math/tex">S'</script> is also an inertial frame.

An aeroplane <script type="math/tex">P</script> is to fly from a point <script type="math/tex">A</script> to an airfield <script type="math/tex">B</script> which is 300 km due north of A. The plane can fly at a speed of 150 km h<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script> relative to the air. A wind of speed 30 km h<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script> blows from the north-west.

</p>
<p>
An aircraft <script type="math/tex">P</script> takes off from a runway that is aligned from west to east parallel to <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script>. The speed of the aircraft (relative to the stationary air) is <script type="math/tex">u</script> and after takeoff it flies due east, climbing at angle <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> to the horizontal. Meanwhile a helicopter <script type="math/tex">H</script> is flying due north at speed <script type="math/tex">v {\hat j}</script> at a constant height <script type="math/tex">h {\hat k}</script> (with <script type="math/tex">h> 0</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> pointing upwards!). 
</p>
<p>
At the moment the aircraft takes off at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script>, the helicopter is at the point <script type="math/tex">a {\hat i}-b{\hat j}+h{\hat k} \  (a, b >0)</script>. Find the time at which the two machines are closest and distance between them at that point. 
</p>
<p>
Clearly it makes sense to draw a diagram (figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figure36">4.5</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Start by defining frames. Let: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000165">
<li id="a0000000166"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">{\cal S}</script> be a coordinate frame that is stationary with respect to the end of the runway,

</li>
<li id="a0000000167"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">{\cal S}'</script> be a coordinate frame that is stationary with respect to the helicopter. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Recall the relationship between position vectors 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)={\vec R}(t)+{\vec r}’(t).</script></span>
<p>
 It would be useful to calculate <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}'(t)</script>. Note that 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000168">
<li id="a0000000169"> <p>
the position of the plane relative to the end of the runway at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> is <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(0)={\vec0}</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000170"> <p>
the position of the helicopter relative to the end of the runway at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> is 
</p>

</li>
<li id="a0000000171"> <p>
the position of the plane at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> relative to the helicopter at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}’(0)={\vec r}(0)-{\vec R}(0)=-a{\hat i}+b{\hat j}-h{\hat k}.</script></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The corresponding relative velocities are then given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}_{P{\cal S}}= {\vec v}_{P{\cal S}'} + {\vec v}_{{\cal S}'{\cal S}}.</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000172">
<li id="a0000000173"> <p>
the velocity of the plane relative to the end of the runway is <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}_{P{\cal S}}=u\cos \theta {\hat i}+u\sin \theta {\hat k}</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000174"> <p>
the velocity of the helicopter relative to the end of the runway is <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}_{{\cal S}'{\cal S}}=v{\hat j}</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000175"> <p>
the velocity of the plane relative to the helicopter is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v}_{P{\cal S}'}={\vec v}_{P{\cal S}}-{\vec v}_{{\cal S}'{\cal S}}=u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k}.</script></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Hence we can write down a vector equation for the position of the plane relative to the helicopter. It is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}’(t)={\vec r}’(0)+{\vec v}_{P{\cal S}'}t=-a{\hat i}+b{\vec j}-h{\hat k}+t\left(u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k} \right)</script></span>
<p>
 which is nothing more than the equation of a line in 3D. 
</p>
<p>
Now the distance of closest approach will occur when <script type="math/tex">|{\vec r}'(t)|</script> or analogously <script type="math/tex">|{\vec r}'(t)|^2 </script> is a minimum. 
</p>
<p>
This occurs when 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}|{\vec r}’(t)|^2 = \frac{d}{dt}\left({\vec r}’(t) \cdot {\vec r}’(t)\right) = \frac{d{\vec r}'(t)}{dt} \cdot {\vec r}’(t) + {\vec r}’(t) \cdot \frac{d{\vec r}'(t)}{dt} = 2{\vec r}’(t)\cdot {\vec v}_{P{\cal S}'} =0</script></span>
<p>
Geometrically this is when <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}_{P{\cal S}'}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}'(t)</script> are perpendicular. 
</p>
<p>
Hence we have 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  0 & =&  \left(u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k} \right) \cdot \left(-a{\hat i}+b{\hat j}-h{\hat k} +t \left(u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k} \right)\right) \\ \Rightarrow \qquad t_{{\rm min}} & =&  -\frac{\left(u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k} \right) \cdot \left(-a{\hat i}+b{\hat j}-h{\hat k}\right)}{|u\cos \theta {\hat i}-v{\hat j}+u\sin \theta {\hat k}|^2} \\ & =&  \frac{au\cos {\theta }+bv+hu\sin {\theta }}{u^2+v^2}. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
The closest distance between the two machines is then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">|{\vec r}’(t_{{\rm min}})|=\sqrt{{\vec r}'(t_{{\rm min}})\cdot {\vec r}'(t_{{\rm min}})}={\rm exercise \  for \  student!}</script></span>
<p>
 Can this ever be zero? In practice the relative speeds of aircraft are so fast (up to over 1000 mph <script type="math/tex">\approx </script> 450 ms<script type="math/tex">^{-1}</script> for civil aircraft) that air traffic controllers try to allow aircraft never to come within a certain non-zero distance of each other. Usually over the Atlantic routes into the UK this is 1000 ft for vertical separation and a few miles for horizontal separation—yes, the Imperial-measures dominate air traffic control!

<h1 id="a0000000176">Special relativity</h1>
<p>
Newtonian mechanics ruled supreme for centuries, describing motion from every day events to the planets orbiting the Sun. However, as experimenters started probing higher velocities (or, equivalently, energies) it became clear that the theory had problems. In particular, at the end of the 19th century there was an apparent conflict between Newtonian physics and the theory of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell and Michael Faraday. This new theory suggested that the speed of light (in vacuum) ought to be constant, regardless of the motion of the observer. This (obviously) does not agree with the Galilean transformations we have considered. 
</p>
<p>
The theory of electromagnetism demonstrates that light is a wave. In order to make sense of this, physicists introduced a medium for these waves to propagate through<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000177">
<sup class="footnotemark">34</sup>
</a>: the luminiferous ether. However, experiments aimed at demonstrating the absolute motion of the Earth through the ether failed (most famously, the effort by Michelson and Morley in 1881). As a resolution, physicists introduced two, seemingly ad hoc, hypotheses: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000178">
<li id="a0000000179"> <p>
rigid bodies are contracted in the direction of travel, and 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000180"> <p>
moving clocks appear to run slow. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Mathematically, the results were contained in (fairly) simple relations called the <em>Lorentz transformation</em>. The effects would impact on any effort to detect the relative motion with respect to the ether, basically cancelling the effects one might intuitively expect. 
</p>
<p>
This description was logically consistent, but there was no way of verifying the assumptions. At least not until 1905, when Albert Einstein provided an elegant derivation based on two postulates. The first is known as <em>the principle of relativity</em>. The second concerns the speed of light, which is taken to be a universal constant. This assumption has a range of curious implications – it forces us to abandon the concept of universal time (which is key to Newtonian mechanics). We also lose the notion of simultaneity. Events may appear to happen at the same time according to one observer, but not according to another. This may seems confusing, but the results are quite easy to demonstrate. We will do this using the <em>k-calculus</em> that was developed by Hermann Bondi in the 1950s. 
</p>
<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000181">5.1 k-calculus</h2>
<p>
Let us start with some familiar. An <b class="bf">event</b> in space and time simply refers to something happening. Everyone can agree on what the event is (what happened), but since different observers may use their own clocks (which may not be synchronised) and measuring devices (perhaps rulers with different scales or simply a different assumed origin), they will not (typically) agree on when and where the event took place. There is nothing mysterious about this.

<p>
Mathematically, we can illustrate the collection of events throughout history in a spacetime diagram, like that in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#st-diagram">5.1</a>. This would (obviously) involve recording how objects move – how they trace out their individual <b class="bf">world lines</b> through space and time. By following each world line we track the object’s history. Now, let us introduce the notion of an <b class="bf">observer</b>. This can be any object that can be equipped with a clock and a ruler, which he/she carries along on the journey through spacetime. Each individual combination of clock and ruler makes up the observer’s <b class="bf">frame of reference</b>. In Newtonian mechanics, we assume that if two observers synchronise their clock then they will continue to agree on the time of all events. Time is absolute. 
</p>
<p>
In order to develop Einstein’s picture, let us start with the principle of relativity: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000182">
<li id="a0000000183"> <p>
All inertial observers are equivalent. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 What does this mean? Well, it says that, if one observer carries out an experiment and discovers a physical laws, then other observes carrying out the same experiment should agree on this law. At least as long as the observers have uniform relative velocity – they must not accelerate because this brings additional forces into play. However, there is more to it than that. In reality we can not determine an absolute position in space or time, we can only ever measure positions relative to some origin. Similarly, a velocity of a body is always relative to some other. Position and velocity are both <b class="bf">relative</b>. This is important. Any experiment our observer may carry out must involve some kind of observation. Therefore the statement of the principle of relative does not refer to the results of particular experiments being equal. This follows by logic.

<p>
We have suggested that we can use a set of clock and rulers to measure events. Let us now dispense of the rulers and make use of the second postulate, the constant speed of light<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000184">
<sup class="footnotemark">35</sup>
</a>. This leads us to (using terminology that may have seemed modern in the 1950s, but which seems unfashionable today) the so-called radar method. If we know the speed of light, then we can easily figure out the position in space of any event (let’s call it <script type="math/tex">P</script>). Simply assuming that the event is associated with a “mirror” we can bounce a light signal off it. In order to avoid confusion, we will work in two dimensions, time and space. This means that we can think of the observers as sitting along a straight line, each with a clock and a mirror (or a flashlight). A given observer (let’s call him/her <script type="math/tex">A</script>, which seems quite imaginative) then carries out measurements like in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#radar">5.2</a>, where the event <script type="math/tex">P(t,x)</script> could be on another observer’s (<script type="math/tex">B</script>) world line. As we are focussing on inertial observers, this second world line will be a straight line at some angle in the coordinate system associated with <script type="math/tex">A</script>. The angle simply depends on the relative velocity, see figures <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#simul">5.3</a> and <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#kca1">5.4</a>. As the relative speed approaches that of light, the angle approaches <script type="math/tex">45^\circ </script>. 
</p>
<p>
In this picture, the spatial distance to the event <script type="math/tex">P</script> in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#radar">5.2</a> is inferred as half the difference between the times of emission and reception. In order to make the analysis simple, it is common to use units such that the speed of light <script type="math/tex">c=1</script>. That is, we measure distance as time intervals (e.g. in light seconds) and we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x= {1\over 2} (t_2 - t_1)</script></span>
<p>
 Similarly, it is easy to see that the time associated with the event will be 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t = {1\over 2} (t_2 + t_1)</script></span>

<span class="caption_text">Illustrating the lack of simultaneity in relativity.</span>

<p>
An immediate implication of this is that we have to abandon the notion of simultaneity. This is easily illustrated with a thought experiment (the kind of which Einstein is famous for). Let us consider a passenger on a train, equipped with two flashlights (and no hesitation using them). Let the person stand in the middle of the carriage and shine the two flashlights towards the front and back of the carriage. The ask, when do the light rays hit the two walls. Our observer would answer that this happens at the same time – the light rays have to travel the same distance at the same (fixed) speed. The events are <em>simultaneous</em>. This is the situation illustrated in the left panel of figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#simul">5.3</a>. Let us now consider the experiment from the point of view of another observer, <script type="math/tex">B</script> standing on a platform as the train whizzes by. Because the train is moving, the two walls will move as the light flashes travel from emission to impact. As a result the distance to the back wall is shorter than that to the front wall. This means that observer <script type="math/tex">B</script> will not agree. The light hits the back wall first. Basically, the order of events is relative depending on who carries out the observation. This is an important lesson.

Let us now relate measurements by two observers moving relative to one another, as in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#kca1">5.4</a>. In order to do this, we assume that the time intervals involved are proportional to one another. This makes sense since the relative velocity is fixed. In effect, if observer <script type="math/tex">A</script> measures an interval <script type="math/tex">T</script> (say between two flashes of a flash light or two ticks on a clock), the <script type="math/tex">B</script> measures <script type="math/tex">kT</script>, where <script type="math/tex">k</script> is constant. This is the fundamental assumption of k-calculus. Note that, from the point of view of the other observer (<script type="math/tex">B</script>) measured time intervals must be related by the same constant of proportionality, as in the right panel of figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#kca1">5.4</a>. Of course, if <script type="math/tex">B</script> moves in the positive <script type="math/tex">x</script>-direction relative to <script type="math/tex">A</script>, then <script type="math/tex">A</script> moves in the negative direction relative to <script type="math/tex">B</script>. It is important to keep this in mind.

<p>
To make progress, consider the set up in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#kcatime">5.5</a>. Assume that the two observers synchronise their clocks at the origin (when they pass through the same point in space). Comparing this figure to figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#radar">5.2</a>, and making use of the inferred relations between time intervals it is easy to see that we have <script type="math/tex">t_1 = T</script> and <script type="math/tex">t_2 = k^2 T</script>. As <script type="math/tex">T</script> varies, this allows us to work out the coordinates associated with events along the world line of <script type="math/tex">B</script>. We have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t = {1\over 2} (k^2 +1) T</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = {1\over 2} (k^2 -1) T</script></span>
<p>
 However, we can relate the result to the relative velocity, since 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = { x\over t} = {k^2 - 1 \over k^2+1}</script></span>
<p>
 Solving for <script type="math/tex">k</script> in terms of <script type="math/tex">v</script> (noting that <script type="math/tex">k</script> must be greater than 1 if <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> move apart), we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">k = \left( {1+v \over 1 -v} \right)^{1/2}</script></span>
<p>
 As we will see later, this is the relativistic formula for the Doppler shift. If <script type="math/tex">B</script> moves away from <script type="math/tex">A</script> then <script type="math/tex">k>1</script> which leads to frequencies being shifted towards the “red”, while they shift towards the “blue” when <script type="math/tex">B</script> moves towards <script type="math/tex">A</script>.

</figure>
<p>
As a slight extension of the example, let us ask how velocities add in this picture. In this case we need to introduce a third observer <script type="math/tex">C</script>. This also involves extra <script type="math/tex">k</script> factors. We denote these as <script type="math/tex">k_{AB}</script>, <script type="math/tex">k_{BC}</script> and <script type="math/tex">k_{AC}</script> as in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#relmot">5.6</a>. However, these factors can not be independent. We must have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">k_{AC} = k_{AB} k_{BC}</script></span>
<p>
 Re-writing this relation in terms of the three relative velocities (which involves a bit of algebra) we arrive at the composition law for velocities: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{AC} = { v_{AB} + v_{BC} \over 1 + v_{AB} v_{BC}}</script></span>
<p>
 This is very important result. In the limit of low velocities (<script type="math/tex">v_{AB}\ll 1</script> etcetera as we assume units where <script type="math/tex">c=1</script>), we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{AC} \approx v_{AB} + v_{BC}</script></span>
<p>
 This accords with our usual (Newtonian) experience. Velocities add. However, now replace one of the observers with a light signal. Taking <script type="math/tex">v_{BC}=1</script> we see that the resulting speed relative to <script type="math/tex">A</script> is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{AC} = { v_{AB} + 1 \over 1 + v_{AB}} = 1</script></span>
<p>
 This is new. We learn that we cannot exceed the speed of light by adding velocities – there is an upper speed limit. If we add two velocities, which are both below the speed of light, we arrive at a composite velocity which is also below the speed of light.

<h2 id="a0000000185">5.2 The Lorentz transformation</h2>
<p>
We are now ready to get to the core argument – the derivation of the Lorentz transformation. In order to discuss this, we consider the setting represented in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#lor1">5.7</a>. We let the event <script type="math/tex">P</script> have coordinates <script type="math/tex">(t,x)</script> with respect to observer <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">(t',x')</script> with respect to observer <script type="math/tex">B</script>. We know from before that observer <script type="math/tex">A</script> has to send out a light signal at <script type="math/tex">t_1 = t-x</script> in order to observe the event at <script type="math/tex">t_2=t+x</script> (see the symmetry in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#radar">5.2</a>). Similarly, observer <script type="math/tex">B</script> has to send out a light signal at <script type="math/tex">t'_1 = t'-x'</script> in order to observe the event at <script type="math/tex">t'_2=t'+x'</script> (it helps to ask what figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#radar">5.2</a> would look like according to <script type="math/tex">B</script>).

<p>
Assuming that the observers have synchronised their clocks at the origin (as before), we know from the k-calculus argument that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t’ - x’ = k(t-x)</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t+x = k(t’+x’)</script></span>
<p>
 Re-arranging these relations (and making use of the result for <script type="math/tex">v</script> in terms of <script type="math/tex">k</script>) we arrive at 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t’ = {1\over 2} \left[ {1\over k} (t+x) + k(t-x) \right] = \gamma ( t-vx )</script></span>

 where

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\gamma = (1 - v^2)^{-1/2}</script></span>

 This is the Lorentz transformation. The derivation is surprisingly simple – once we have laid the foundations by discussing measurements carried out by observers in relative motion. 
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting (and quite easy to show) that the quantity <script type="math/tex">t^2-x^2</script> is invariant under the Lorentz transformation. That is, we have

<h2 id="a0000000186">5.3 Implications: length contraction and time dilation</h2>
<p>
With the Lorentz transformation in hand, let us consider a couple of implications. The basic story is simple – we have to accept that space and time are flexible, and that measurements depend on the motion of the observer. 
</p>
<p>
First of all, consider a rod moving with speed <script type="math/tex">v</script> in the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-direction relative to a fixed observer, as in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#lcon">5.8</a>. If we measure the length of the rod at rest (in the moving frame), we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">l_0 = x’_ B-x’_ A</script></span>
<p>
 But this is not the length measured by the fixed non-moving observer. Instead, this observer measures 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">l = x_ B-x_ A</script></span>
<p>
 However, if this measurement is done at time <script type="math/tex">t=t_0</script> (on the non-moving clock), then we know that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x’_ A = \gamma (x_ A-vt_0)</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x’_ B=\gamma (x_ B-vt_0)</script></span>
<p>
 so we find 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">l_0 = x’_ B-x’_ A= \gamma (x_ B-x_ A) = \gamma l \  \longrightarrow \  l < l_0</script></span>
<p>
 The moving rod appears to be contracted in the direction of travel. 
</p>
<figure id="lcon">

</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
Now consider a moving clock. With the clock at rest in the primed frame (the same as in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#lcon">5.8</a>), two ticks of the clock are given by coordinates<script type="math/tex">(x'_1, t'_1)</script> and <script type="math/tex">(x'_1, t'_2)=(x'_1, t'_1+T_0)</script> (say). Transforming this into the non-moving frame<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000187">
<sup class="footnotemark">36</sup>
</a> we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t_1 = \gamma (t’_1 + vx’_1)</script></span>
<p>
 and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">t_2 = \gamma (t’_1 + T_0 + vx’_1)</script></span>
<p>
 This means that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=t_2-t_1 = \gamma T_0 \  \longrightarrow \  T>T_0</script></span>
<p>
 Time intervals on the moving clock appear longer, so the clock seems to run slow. This is called <em>time dilation</em>. 
</p>
<p>
It is also instructive to consider the Doppler shift. We know from everyday experience that the frequency of a moving object (say the siren of an ambulance) is affected by relative motion. To see how this comes about, consider a source emitting waves with wavelength <script type="math/tex">\lambda _0</script> in the frame of the emitter. Suppose the source is a flashing light. If two flashes are emitted a time <script type="math/tex">\delta t'</script> apart, then the second flash has to travel a distance <script type="math/tex">v \delta t'</script> further in order to reach a non-moving observer. This means that is will arrive a time <script type="math/tex">v \delta t'/c</script> later. That is, the flashes arrive with a time difference 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\delta t = \left(1 + {v\over c} \right) \delta t’</script></span>
<p>
 Translating this into wavelength (inverse of frequency=proportional to time interval) we see that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\lambda \over \lambda _0} = 1 + {v\over c}</script></span>
<p>
 This is an entirely classical effect. Of course, it will be affected by relativity. Adding in the time dilation the time difference will be measured by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\delta t \to \gamma \delta t = \gamma \left(1 + {v\over c} \right) \delta t’</script></span>
<p>
 so now we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\lambda \over \lambda _0} = \gamma \left( 1 + {v\over c} \right) = \left( {1+v/c \over 1-v^2/c^2}\right)^{1/2} = \left( {1+v/c\over 1-v/c} \right)^{1/2}</script></span>
<p>
 But we have seen this result before. The relativistic Doppler shift is simply the <script type="math/tex">k</script>-factor.

<h2 id="a0000000188">5.4 Paradoxes</h2>
<p>
Special relativity is (famously) associated with a number of (apparent) paradoxes. This is not surprising – we are messing with fundamental concepts like space and time, and the implications may be uncomfortable. These paradoxes are typically designed in such way that the theory appears to be inconsistent – but at a closer inspection one always finds that everything is fine. 
</p>
<p>
As an example, let us consider the so-called “barn paradox”. This story involves a pole (perhaps carried by an olympic pole vaulter), parallel to the ground, moving at relativistic speed towards a barn. The pole is imagined passing through the open front and rear doors of barn which is shorter than its rest length, so if the pole was not moving it would not to fit inside. To a stationary observer (perhaps a cheeky farmer), due to length contraction, the moving pole should fit inside the barn as it passes through. Of course, from the point of view of the person carrying the pole it is the barn which will be Lorentz contracted. Therefore the pole can not possibly fit inside the barn. This poses an apparent contradiction. 
</p>
<p>
This paradox results from the mistaken assumption of absolute simultaneity. The pole is said to fit into the barn if both of its ends can be made to be simultaneously inside. The paradox is resolved when we consider that in relativity, simultaneity is relative to each observer, making the answer to whether the pole fits inside the barn relative to each of them. We can illustrate this by drawing the different coordinate systems arising from the Lorentz contraction on top of one another. This leads to figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#lcoords">5.9</a>. 
</p>
<figure id="lcoords">
<div class="centered"> <img src="../../notes/course_notes/images/img-0086.png" style="width:361.34999999999997pt"/>

<span class="caption_text">The relation between coordinate axes according to the Lorentz transformation.</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
With this picture in hand it is easy to see how the issue of simultaneity enters the length contraction argument (and ultimately resolves the barn paradox). An illustration of this – for the case of a rod moving away from the observer – is provided in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#lresolve">5.10</a>.

<p>
Another famous paradox involves a pair of twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. At first, this result is puzzling because each twin should see the other twin as moving, and so each should (paradoxically) find the other to have aged less. Can you figure out how to use a spacetime diagram to resolve the issue?

</section><section class="section">
<h2 id="interval">5.5 Going further: Relativistic dynamics</h2>
<p>
Having explored the kinematics of special relativity, let us move on to dynamics. The first (important) step connects with the Lorentz transformation. If we consider small space and time intervals then we have seen that the <em>spacetime interval</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000189">
<sup class="footnotemark">37</sup>
</a>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ds^2 = - dt^2 + dx^2 \label{interval}</script></span>
<p>
 is invariant – we get the same value for <script type="math/tex">ds^2</script> in a fixed and a moving frame. Let us now define the proper time (=the time measured on a co-moving clock) through 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="proptime">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}d\tau ^2 = - ds^2 \label{proptime}\tag{5.1}\end{equation}</script>
</div>
<p>
 (recalling that we are using units where the speed of light, <script type="math/tex">c=1</script>). 
</p>
<p>
In order to define the squared distance in space-time, we need to introduce a new dot-product which reflects the combination used in the invariant spacetime interval. First we need the concept of a four-vector<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000190">
<sup class="footnotemark">38</sup>
</a>; 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">d \vec{X} = \left(\begin{array}{l} dt \\ dx \end{array}\right)</script></span>
<p>
Recalling the usual dot product; 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v^2 = \boldsymbol v \cdot \boldsymbol v = \left( v_1 \quad v_2 \right) \left( \begin{array}{l} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right) = \left( v_1 \quad v_2 \right) \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 &  0 \\ 0 &  1 \end{array}\right) \left( \begin{array}{l} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right) = v_1^2 + v_2^2</script></span>
<p>
 and comparing to the spacetime interval, it is easy to see that we now need 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ds^2 = d\vec{X}\cdot d\vec{X} = \left( dt \quad dx \right) \left( \begin{array}{cccc} -1 &  0 \\ 0 &  1 \end{array}\right) \left( \begin{array}{l} dt \\ dx \end{array}\right) = -dt^2 + dx^2</script></span>
<p>
For future reference, the matrix 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\eta = \left( \begin{array}{cccc} -1 &  0 \\ 0 &  1 \end{array}\right)</script></span>
<p>
 is called the metric – so named because it allows us to measure distance in space-time. However, for our present purposes we only need to know the rule for the new dot-product; basically that the product of the time-components come with a minus sign, while the squares of spatial components are added, as usual. 
</p>
<p>
As we are interested in dynamics, we need a velocity for objects moving in space-time. Thus we define the four-velocity 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec U = {d \vec X \over d\tau }</script></span>
<p>
 and it is easy to see (using <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#proptime">(5.1)</a>) that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec U \cdot \vec U = {d \vec X \over d\tau } \cdot {d \vec X \over d\tau } = {ds^2 \over d\tau ^2} = - 1</script></span>
<p>
 (if we put the the correct units in, then the right-hand side should be <script type="math/tex">-c^2</script>). In effect, the normalisation of the four-velocity means that it has only three undetermined components – just like the velocity in Newtonian physics. 
</p>
<p>
As a slight aside (at least at this point) it is worth considering the four-velocity as measured by an observer not riding along with the object in question. This observer would (still in 2D) measure a (four-) vector 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec U = ( U^0 \quad U^1)</script></span>
<p>
 such that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec U \cdot \vec U = - (U^0)^2 + (U^1)^2 = - 1</script></span>
<p>
 or 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(U^0)^2 \left[ 1 - \left( {U^1 \over U^0} \right) \right] = - 1</script></span>
<p>
 Now let <script type="math/tex">U^0=A</script> and define the relative velocity of the observer and the measured object as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = {U^1 \over U^0}</script></span>
<p>
 Then it follows that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">A = \gamma = \left( 1 - v^2 \right)^{-1/2}</script></span>
<p>
 We recognise this as the Lorentz factor from before. This should, of course, have been expected. In general, it means that the four-velocity takes the form 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="fourmom">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}\vec U = \gamma \left( 1 \quad \boldsymbol v \right) \label{fourvel}\tag{5.2}\end{equation}</script>
</div>
<p>
It is also worth noting that the Lorentz transformation applies to general four-vectors. Staying in 2D, we have<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000191">
<sup class="footnotemark">39</sup>
</a>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(U^0)’= \gamma (V) \left( U^0 - V U^1\right)</script></span>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(U^1)’ = \gamma (V) \left( U^1 - V U^0\right)</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">V</script> is the relative velocity between the two frames and 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\gamma (V) = \left( 1 - V^2 \right)^{-1/2}</script></span>
<p>
Applying this transformation to <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#fourmom">(5.2)</a>, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(U^1)’= \gamma (V) \gamma (v) (v-V)</script></span>
<p>
 which vanishes if we make the observer move along with the object (<script type="math/tex">V\to v</script>), which is kind of obvious. In this co-moving frame, we also find that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(U^0)’ = \gamma ^2(v) ( 1 - v^2) = 1</script></span>
<p>
 as expected. 
</p>
<p>
Moving towards dynamics, we define the four-momentum as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec P = m \vec U</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">m</script> is the mass of the object under consideration. It is easy to see that this means that we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec P = m \gamma ( 1 \quad \boldsymbol v ) \label{fourmom}</script></span>
<p>
 and it also follows (immediately) that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec P \cdot \vec P = - m^2</script></span>
<p>
Consider the expression for the four momentum in the low-velocity limit where <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol v\ll 1 \  (=c)</script>. First of all, the spatial components clearly lead back to the Newtonian momentum <script type="math/tex">\boldsymbol p = m \boldsymbol v</script>. Meanwhile, the time component leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P^0 = m\gamma \approx m + {1\over 2} mv^2</script></span>
<p>
 or, if we put the speed of light back in 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P^0 = m\gamma \approx mc^2 + {1\over 2} mv^2</script></span>
<p>
 We recognise the second term as the kinetic energy. This means that the first term has to be an energy, as well. There is an energy associated with mass! Letting <script type="math/tex">E=P^0</script> we see that we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E = mc^2</script></span>
<p>

<h1 id="a0000000192">Conservation Laws</h1>
<p>
Let us now introduce the (hugely important) idea of conservation laws. As the name suggests, a conserved quantity is one that does not change throughout the motion of a system. Conservation laws can often be used as an alternative formulation of dynamical problems—they allow us to introduce suitable variables that remain fixed as the system evolves<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000193">
<sup class="footnotemark">40</sup>
</a>. We will deal with two major conservation properties, relating to <b class="bfseries">energy</b> and <b class="bfseries">momentum</b>. These conservation laws extend the range of mechanical problems we can attack. We shall also use the concept of energy to discuss the <i class="it">stability</i> of an static situation: if a static system is displaced slightly, will it return to the same static state, or will there be a dramatic (or even catastrophic) change in its structure. We have already alluded to these properties in the context of potential motion.

<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000194">6.1 Energy</h2>
<p>
The history of the concept of energy is long and varied. We might easily be able to mathematically define an quantity that we could call the energy, and have an intuitive idea of what it means. However historically there were great issues with the concept of physical mechanisms that could convert, say, thermal energy into energy of motion. Were they the same “thing”? How was this achieved? Did they have the same origin? What was the mechanical equivalent of heat? This was not some arcane academic debate: it underlay the whole of the industrial revolution in the UK , which was largely powered by the conversion of the thermal energy of steam into the kinetic energy of pumps/wheels/looms etc. and so the industrial revolution of the whole world. 
</p>
<p>
Originally heat energy was assumed to be a fluid (the caloric theory) that was transferred between bodies and could neither be created nor destroyed. This theory was demolished by the major experimental advances of James Joule who showed that heat can be produced by motion. For this reason the unit of energy is named the “joule”. A joule can be defined in many equivalent ways, for example: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000195">
<li id="a0000000196"> <p>
The energy expended by a force of 1N moving an object a distance of 1 m in the direction of the force. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000197"> <p>
The energy expended when a current of 1 amp to pass through an (ohmic) electrical resistance of 1 ohm. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will not be concerned with the philosophical issues of energy. Rather, we will use it as a mathematical tool. 
</p>
</section><section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000198">6.2 Work and Energy</h2>
<p>
It is natural to start by introducing the idea of energy from Newton’s laws of motion. We know that Newton’s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum <script type="math/tex">{\vec p}</script> with time is equal to the force applied <script type="math/tex">\vec F</script>: <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=\frac{d{\vec p}}{dt}.</script></span> </span> <br/>Here we shall consider this body to be of <i class="it">constant</i> mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> at position <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)</script> relative to a certain intertial frame. Using the definition <script type="math/tex">{\vec p}=m{\dot{\vec r}}(t)</script>, we can then write <b class="bf">N2</b> as: <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec{ F}=m{ \ddot{\vec r}}(t).</script></span> </span> <br/>We can dot-product both sides with the velocity <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{ \vec r}}(t)</script>. <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}  \vec{ F}\cdot { \dot{ \vec r}}(t) = m\left({ \ddot{\vec r}}(t)\cdot { \dot{\vec r}}(t)\right) \\ = \frac{1}{2}m\frac{d}{dt}\left({ \dot{\vec r}}(t)\cdot { \dot{\vec r}}(t)\right) \\ = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}m|{ \dot{\vec r}}(t)|^2\right). \label{echange} \end{multline}</script></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
The kinetic energy <script type="math/tex">T</script> of a particle of constant mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and velocity <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{\vec r}}(t)</script> relative to an inertial frame is then  defined to be: <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T\equiv \frac{1}{2}m|{ \dot{\vec r}}(t)|^2.</script></span> </span> <br/>
</p>
<p>
Obviously the kinetic energy of a stationary particle is zero relative to its own rest frame. Thus the quantity on the left-hand side of <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#echange">(6.3)</a> is the rate of change of kinetic energy with time <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec{ F}\cdot { \dot{ \vec r}}(t)=\frac{dT}{dt}.</script></span> </span> <br/>Suppose that between <script type="math/tex">t=a</script> and <script type="math/tex">t=b</script>, the particle moves from <script type="math/tex">{ r}(a)</script> to <script type="math/tex">{ r}(b)</script>. We can then integrate both sides with respect to <script type="math/tex">t</script> to give: <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _{a}^{b}{ \vec F}\cdot \frac{d{ \vec r}}{dt}dt=\int _{a}^{b}\frac{dT}{dt}dt = T(b)-T(a).</script></span></span> <br/>The right-hand side is the difference in kinetic energy of the body at times <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script>. The left-hand side is the amount of energy that must have been expended by the force to make this change. It is defined to be the work done by the force on the particle. Hence we have: 
</p>
<p>
The work <script type="math/tex">W</script> done by a force <script type="math/tex">F</script> on a particle moving along a trajectory <script type="math/tex">{ r}(t)</script> in time <script type="math/tex">a\le t \le b</script> is the amount of energy given by the integral <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <div class="eqn" id="workint">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}W({\vec r}(a),{\vec r}(b)) \equiv \int _{a}^{b}{ \vec F}\cdot \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}dt = \int _ a^ b \vec F \cdot d\vec r \label{workint}\tag{6.4}\end{equation}</script>
</div> </span> and we have derived the law of conservation of energy: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">W(a,b)=T(b)-T(a)</script></span> </span> <br/>In words the law of conservation of energy states that the work done equals the change in kinetic energy of a system. If <script type="math/tex">W>0</script>, the force has increased the speed of the particle. If <script type="math/tex">W<0</script>, the force has resisted the motion of the particle, it has reduced in speed and dissipated energy. 
</p>
<p>
Overall energy is conserved. The work done decelerating (say) a body will be dissipated as frictional heat and/or acoustic energy. The work done accelerating a body to increase its kinetic energy must come from a source, such as chemical combustion of a fuel. However for now, we will not be concerned with the form of the energy that the work done takes. 
</p>
<p>
Before we can use <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#workint">(6.4)</a> we need to define how we evaluate the weird looking work integral. Such integrals are called <b class="bf">line integrals</b> because they are integrals that depend on the path over which the integration is carried out. <br/>

<h2 id="a0000000199">6.3 A slight aside: Vector Fields and Line Integrals</h2>
<p>
As a useful reminder, let us outline some jargon that you will come across in reading texts about how to evaluate line integrals. 
</p>
<p>
First of all, a <em>scalar field</em> is just a fancy description for an ordinary function defined at each point in space. The input is a vector <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}=x{\vec i}+y{\hat j}+z{\hat k}</script>, (where <script type="math/tex">x,y,</script> and <script type="math/tex">z</script> may themselves depend on another parameter, e.g., time <script type="math/tex">t</script>) the output is a number <script type="math/tex">f({\vec r})=f(x,y,z)</script>. Example of scalar fields are: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000200">
<li id="a0000000201"> <p>
the altitude of a landscape above (or below) sea level; 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000202"> <p>
temperature of the atmosphere; 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000203"> <p>
the pressure of the atmosphere; 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000204"> <p>
the wind <i class="it">speed</i> at a point. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Scalar fields are often represented by drawing contour plots of curves/surfaces where <script type="math/tex">f({\vec r})=</script>constant. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, a <span class="rm">vector field</span> is a function whose input is a vector <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}=x{\vec i}+y{\hat j}+z{\hat k}</script> while theoutput is a vector quantity. In a Cartesian frame it takes the form <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}({\vec r})=F_1({\vec r}){\hat i}+F_2({\vec r}){\hat j}+F_3({\vec r}){\hat k} .</script></span> </span> <br/>Examples of vector fields are: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000205">
<li id="a0000000206"> <p>
the wind <i class="it">velocity</i> on a weather map;

<li id="a0000000207"> <p>
the Earth’s magnetic field at any point on its surface;

</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000209"> <p>
the vorticity of a fluid flow. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Vector fields are usually represented with arrow plots, where the length of the arrow is proportional to the strength of the field. The forces in <b class="bf">N2</b> can be regarded as vector fields. 
</p>
<p>
If we want to quantify the work done by a certain process, we need to evaluate a line integral. An ordinary 1D integral is the integration of a scalar function <script type="math/tex">f\left( x \right)</script> over a straight line segment <script type="math/tex">a \le x \le b</script> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _ a^ b f(x)\; dx</script></span> </span> It represents the area between <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> and the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-axis between <script type="math/tex">x=a</script> and <script type="math/tex">x=b</script>. If <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> represents the height of a straight fence, then the integral is the area of the fence panels. 
</p>
<p>
The work integral we need to evaluate <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int _{a}^{b}{\vec F}\cdot \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}dt</script></span> </span> is a generalisation of this definition.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000210">

</a>
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000211">
<li id="a0000000212"> <p>
First the integration is now over a given curve <script type="math/tex">C</script>, or <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)</script> with <script type="math/tex">a \le t\le b</script>. This is equivalent to working out the area of a fence that is placed along a curved base. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000213"> <p>
Second, the integrand involves vector functions <script type="math/tex">\vec F</script> and <script type="math/tex">{ \dot{\vec r}}</script>. However these combine as a dot product to form a scalar function <script type="math/tex">\vec F\cdot { \dot{\vec r}}</script>. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We represent the trajectory by the curve <script type="math/tex">C</script>: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}(t)=x(t){\hat i}+y(t){\hat j}+z(t){\hat k}, \quad a \leq t \leq b</script></span> </span> which has a tangent vector <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \hat i + \frac{dy}{dt}\hat j + \frac{dz}{dt}\hat k,\quad a \leq t \leq b.</script></span> </span> With these definitions, the force experienced by the particle will (in general) differ at each point of the trajectory. <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000214">
<sup class="footnotemark">42</sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
To evaluate the integral, we evaluate <script type="math/tex">\vec F</script> at each point on the trajectory as a function of the curve parameter <script type="math/tex">t</script>, take the dot product <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}\cdot \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt},</script></span> </span> and then integrate the resulting scalar function of <script type="math/tex">t</script> between <script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script>. Sometimes the work done depends on the path taken by the body. Sometimes it does not.

<h2 id="cons">6.4 Conservation of Linear Momentum</h2>
<p>
Energy is not the only quantity that is conserved in Newtonian mechanics. We may also consider the linear momentum. 
</p>
<p>
<b class="bf">N2</b> tells us that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=\frac{d{\vec p}}{dt},</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">{\vec p}=m{ \dot{\vec r}}</script> is the linear momentum of the body. If there are no external forces acting, then <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{d{\vec p}}{dt}=0 \Rightarrow {\vec p}={\rm constant}.</script></span> </span> Hence we see that the linear momentum of a body is conserved if the total force on it is zero. 
</p>
<p>
Components of momentum can also be conserved. Suppose <script type="math/tex">{\vec s}</script> is a constant vector such that <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}\cdot {\vec s}={\vec0}</script>. Thus the force <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> has no component in the <script type="math/tex">{\vec s}</script> direction. If we take the scalar product of both sides of <script type="math/tex">{\vec N2}</script> with <script type="math/tex">{\vec s}</script> we obtain: <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=\frac{d{\vec p}}{dt} \Rightarrow {\vec F}\cdot {\vec s}=\frac{d{\vec p}}{dt}\cdot {\vec s} \Rightarrow {\vec0}=\frac{d({\vec p}\cdot {\vec s})}{dt}</script></span> </span> (since <script type="math/tex">{\vec s}</script> is constant). Hence we deduce that <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec p}\cdot {\vec s}={\rm constant}.</script></span> </span> In words, the <em>component</em> of linear momentum in a direction in which the component of force vanishes is constant in time.

An astronaut plays golf on the surface of the moon, where there is little atmosphere (i.e., negligible air resistance). The golf ball of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> is launched and moves with velocity <script type="math/tex">{\vec v}(t)</script>, subject only to the moon’s gravity <script type="math/tex">-g{\hat k}</script>.

<h2 id="a0000000215">6.5 Conservative Forces and potentials</h2>
<p>
In the context of mechanics, conservative forces represent a special class of force fields for which the work done on a body by the field is independent of the motion<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000216">
<sup class="footnotemark">43</sup>
</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The idea is simple. If a force field <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}({\vec r})</script> at any point <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}(t)=x(t){\vec i}+y(t){\hat j}+z(t){\hat k}</script> can be represented by the gradient of a scalar function <script type="math/tex">V({\vec r})</script> of the form<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000217">

</a> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}({\vec r}) \equiv -\nabla V({\vec r})</script></span> </span> then it is a <b class="bf">conservative force field.</b>
</p>
<p>
The work done by such a field is independent of the path taken, it depends only on the initial and final states. 
</p>
<p>
If a force is conservative such that <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}=-\nabla V</script>, then the function <script type="math/tex">V</script> is called the <b class="bf">potential energy</b> of the field (or <b class="bf">potential</b> for short). 
</p>
<p>
Let us consider a simple example. 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]Gravity 
</p>
<p>
Gravity is a conservative force field. If we take the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis to point upwards, then <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F} = - mg{\hat k} \Rightarrow {\vec F} = -\frac{d}{d z} (mgz) {\hat k}</script></span> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Rightarrow {\vec F} = - {d \over dz}(mgz)</script></span></span> The gravitational potential is thus 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(z)=+mgz.</script></span>
<p>
If the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis had instead pointed downwards, we would have obtained <script type="math/tex">V = -mgz</script>. In both cases, an arbitrary constant can be added.

Conservation of energy can often be used as an alternative to the solution of a dynamical system using <b class="bf">N2</b>. This example provides a demonstration. 
</p>
<p>
A body of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> is thrown vertically upward under the action of a gravitational field <script type="math/tex">{-mg}{\hat k}</script>. Suppose that the particle has initial speed <script type="math/tex">v_ a</script> at height <script type="math/tex">z_ a{\hat k}</script>. Find its speed <script type="math/tex">v=|{ \dot{\vec r}}|</script> as a function of position 
</p>
<p>
Gravity is a conservative force with potential (see above) <script type="math/tex">V(z)=mgz</script>. In the absence of non-conservative fields we have <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  T(z)+V(z)& =& {\rm constant}= E, {\rm \  \  say}\\ \frac{1}{2}m|{\vec\dot {r}}|^2+mgz & =&  {\rm constant} =\frac{1}{2}mv_ a^2+mgz_ a \\ \frac{1}{2}mv^2+mgz & =&  \frac{1}{2}mv_ a^2+mgz_ a \\ \Rightarrow v(z)& =&  \pm \sqrt{v_ a^2+2g(z_ a-z)} \  \  {\rm or} \\ v(z)& =&  \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{m}}\sqrt{E-mgz} \end{eqnarray*}</script></span> </span> <br/>The maximum height of the body is reached when <script type="math/tex">v(z)=0</script>, i.e., <script type="math/tex">z-z_ a = v_ a^2/ (2g)</script>.

<h2 id="a0000000218">6.6 One-dimensional motion</h2>
<p>
Let us now focus on a body moving along a line, so that its position is determined by a single function <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> (say). For now, suppose that the force on the particle depends only on the position, not the velocity. That is, we have <script type="math/tex">F = F (x)</script>. We then define the potential <script type="math/tex">V (x)</script> in such a way that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">F(x) = - {dV \over dx}</script></span>
<p>
 (note the sign!). Obviously, the potential is only defined up to a constant. We can always invert the equation by integrating both sides. The integration constant is now determined by the choice of lower limit of the integral, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(x) = - \int _{x_0}^ x F(x’) dx’</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">x'</script> is a dummy variable. Given the definition of the potential, we can write the equation of motion as 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="coneom">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}m\ddot x = - {dV \over dx} \label{coneom}\tag{6.5}\end{equation}</script>

For any force in one dimension which depends only on the position, there exists a conserved <b class="bf">energy</b>, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E= {1\over 2} m\dot x^2 + V(x)</script></span>
<p>
 As before, the fact that this is conserved means that <script type="math/tex">\dot E =0</script> for any trajectory that obeys the equation of motion. Introducing the kinetic energy, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = {1\over 2} m \dot x^2</script></span>
<p>
 it is easy to show that the energy is conserved. We only need to differentiate to get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot E = m \dot x \ddot x + {dV \over dx} \dot x = \dot x \left(m\ddot x +{dV \over dx} \right) = 0</script></span>
<p>
 where the last equality holds courtesy of the equation of motion <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#coneom">(6.5)</a>. We also see why the sign of the potential in Newton’s second law makes sense. 
</p>
<p>
In any physical system, conserved quantities of this kind are precious—because they help us simplifying the solution. Hence, we will spend some time finding them and showing how they help us simplify various problems.

If a body is stationary it is said to be in equilibrium. From <b class="bf">N2</b> we have seen that a necessary condition for this is that the sum of the forces acting on the body <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> must vanish. Now if all the forces acting on the system are conservative so that <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}=- V'</script> we then have a necessary condition for equilibrium as <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}={\vec0} \longrightarrow V’=0.</script></span> </span> Thus a system will be in equilibrium at a stationary point (or critical point) of the potential.

Consider a potential function <script type="math/tex">V(x)</script> that behaves qualitatively like that in the diagram with a minimum of potential energy at a point <script type="math/tex">x_0</script>. Suppose a particle is released from rest a point <script type="math/tex">x_1</script> relative to the minimum. By conservation of total energy, <script type="math/tex">E=E(x_1)</script>=constant, throughout the motion the kinetic, <script type="math/tex">T</script>, and potential, <script type="math/tex">V</script>, energies are related by <br/><span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E=T+V \Rightarrow T=E-V.</script></span> </span> <br/>Now since <script type="math/tex">T=m|{ \dot{\vec r}}|^2/2</script> we must have <script type="math/tex">T\ge 0</script>. Hence we can write 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textcolor{black}{T \ge 0 \Rightarrow E-V \ge 0 \Rightarrow V \le E }</script></span>
<p>
 i.e. the motion is confined to regions where <script type="math/tex">V\le E</script>. Thus the particle will oscillate in a finite region around the minimum of V and so the motion is bounded. Hence the equilibrium point is said to be stable.

<p>
Consider now a potential that has a maximum at <script type="math/tex">x_0</script>. If a particle released from a small distance away, <script type="math/tex">x_1</script>, again energy is conserved <script type="math/tex">E=E(x_1)</script>=constant throughout the motion. Now since the kinetic energy must be non-negative, we can again write 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textcolor{black}{T \ge 0 \Rightarrow E-V \ge 0 \Rightarrow V \le E }</script></span>
<p>
 so again, the the only classically allowed motion must have <script type="math/tex">V \le E</script>. Hence the particle cannot approach the maximum and must move away from it. As it does so the kinetic energy <script type="math/tex">T</script> and hence speed will increase. Hence the equilibrium point is said to be unstable.

<h2 id="a0000000229">6.8 Moving in a potential</h2>
<p>
Let us consider the general case of a potential <script type="math/tex">V(x)</script>. It turns out that we can learn quite a lot about the motion without actually solving the problem. For example, the existence of a conserved energy magically allows us to turn the problem into a first order differential equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E = {1\over 2} m\dot x^2 + V(x) \quad \longrightarrow \quad {dx \over dt} = \pm \sqrt{{2\over m} \left[ E-V(x)\right]}</script></span>
<p>
 Noting that the right-hand side does not depend on <script type="math/tex">t</script>, we have our first hint of the hint of the importance of conserved quantities in solving a problem. Of course, to go from a second order equation (like <b class="bf">N2</b>) to a first order equation, we must have chosen an integration constant. In this case, this is the energy <script type="math/tex">E</script> itself. Given a first order equation, we can always write down a formal solution for the dynamics by integrating. We have 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="intform">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}t-t_0 = \pm \int _{x_0}^ x {dx’ \over \sqrt{{2\over m} \left[ E-V(x')\right]} } \label{intform}\tag{6.6}\end{equation}</script>
</div>
<p>
 If we can work out the integral, we are done. If we can’t do the integral, you sometimes hear that the problem has been “reduced to quadrature”. This really means “I can’t do the integral”, but it is often the case that having a solution in this form still sheds light on some of the properties. And, if nothing else, one can always evaluate the integral numerically – computers are really good at integration.

Given the potential <script type="math/tex">V (x)</script>, it is often easy to figure out the qualitative nature of any trajectory simply by looking at the form of <script type="math/tex">V(x)</script>. This allows us to answer some questions with very little work<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000231">

<p>
 If we were to substitute this into the general form <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#intform">(6.6)</a>, we have a fearsome looking integral which we struggle to solve<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000232">
<sup class="footnotemark">47</sup>
</a>. Luckily, we can make progress even without solving the integral. The potential is plotted in figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#potplot1">6.5</a>. Let us start with the particle sitting stationary at some position <script type="math/tex">x_0</script>. This means that the energy is

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E=V(x_0)</script></span>
<p>
 and we know that this must remain constant during the subsequent motion. What happens next depends only on <script type="math/tex">x_0</script>. We can identify the following possibilities: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000233">
<li id="a0000000234"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">x_0=\pm 1</script>. These are the local maximum and minimum. If we drop the particle at these points, it stays there for all time.

It can never stop before it reaches <script type="math/tex">x=1</script> for at its stopping point it would have only potential energy <script type="math/tex">V<2m</script>. But, similarly, it cannot arrive at <script type="math/tex">x=1</script> with any excess kinetic energy.

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One can easily play a similar game to that above if the starting speed is not zero. In general, one finds that the particle is trapped in the dip <script type="math/tex">x\in [-1,+1]</script> if its energy lies in the interval <script type="math/tex">E\in [-2m,2m]</script>.

 [width=%+10mm]The harmonic oscillator 
</p>
<p>
The harmonic oscillator is, by far, the most important dynamical system in all of mathematical physics. The good news is that it is very easy to deal with. (In fact, the reason that it is so important is precisely because it is easy!). The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator is defined to be 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(x) = {1\over 2} k x^2</script></span>
<p>
 The harmonic oscillator is a good model for, among other things, a particle attached to the end of a spring. The force resulting from the energy <script type="math/tex">V</script> is given by <script type="math/tex">F=-kx</script> which, in the context of the spring, is Hooke’s law. The equation of motion is (again, as before)

<script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> are integration constants and <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> is called the angular frequency (also... as before).

<h2 id="a0000000240">6.10 Why (almost) everything is a harmonic oscillator</h2>
<p>
A particle placed at an <b class="bf">equilibrium</b> point will stay there for all time. In the example with a cubic potential, we had two such equilibrium points: <script type="math/tex">x=\pm 1</script>. In general, if we want <script type="math/tex">\dot x=0</script> for all time, then clearly we must have <script type="math/tex">\ddot x=0</script>, which, from the form of the equation of motion, tells us that we can identify the equilibrium points with the critical points of the potential, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{dV \over dx} = 0</script></span>
<p>
 What happens to a particle that is close to an equilibrium point, <script type="math/tex">x_0</script> (say)? In this case, we can Taylor expand the potential energy about <script type="math/tex">x = x_0</script>. Because, by definition, the first derivative vanishes, we have 
</p>
<div class="eqn" id="potexp">
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}V(x) \approx V(x_0) + {1\over 2} V''(x_0) (x-x_0)^2 + \ldots \label{potexp}\tag{6.7}\end{equation}</script>
</div>
<p>
 In order to proceed, we need to know the sign of <script type="math/tex">V''(x_0)</script>. 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000241">
<li id="a0000000242"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">V''(x_0)>0</script>. In this case, the equilibrium is a minimum of the potential and the potential energy is that of a harmonic oscillator. The particle oscillates backwards and forwards around <script type="math/tex">x_0</script> with frequency 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega = \sqrt{V''(x_0)\over m}</script></span>
<p>
 Such equilibria are stable. As long as the amplitude of the oscillations is small enough (so that we can ignore the <script type="math/tex">(x-x_0)^3</script> and higher order terms in the Taylor expansion), all systems oscillating around a stable fixed point behave like a harmonic oscillator. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000243"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">V''(x_0)<0</script>. In this case, the equilibrium point is a maximum of the potential. The equation of motion again reads 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot x = - V”(x_0) (x-x_0)</script></span>
<p>
 but if the second derivative of the potential is negative, then we have <script type="math/tex">\ddot x >0</script> when <script type="math/tex">x-x_0>0</script>. This means that if we displace the system a little bit away from the equilibrium point, the acceleration pushes it further away. The equilibrium is unstable.

<h2 id="a0000000245">6.11 Addendum: Taylor expansions</h2>
<p>
The Taylor series is one of the most useful mathematical tools applied to real life problems. As in the example of potential motion near equilibrium, we can often use a Taylor series to approximate a complicated function by a (simpler) polynomial function. 
</p>
<p>
The starting point is Taylor’s theorem (which we state without proof, as we are mainly interested in the applications): 
</p>
<p>
Let <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> be continuous and differentiable an infinite number of times at point <script type="math/tex">x=a</script> (i.e., <script type="math/tex">f</script> and all of its derivatives <script type="math/tex">f', f'',\ldots </script> exist at <script type="math/tex">x=a</script>). Then <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> can be expanded about the point <script type="math/tex">x=a</script> in terms of powers of <script type="math/tex">(x-a)</script>, and this expansion is given by the formula <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline*}  f(x) = \textcolor{black}{ f(a) + (x-a) f'(a) + {{(x-a)^2} \over 2!} f''(a) + \dots } \\ \textcolor{black}{ + \frac{(x-a)^ n}{n!} f^{(n)}(a) +O(x-a)^{n+1} } \end{multline*}</script></span>
<p>
 This is a <b class="bf">Taylor expansion</b>. It has the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = P_ n(x) + O(x-a)^{n+1}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">P_ n(x)</script> is a polynomial of degree <script type="math/tex">n</script> and <script type="math/tex">O(x-a)^{n+1}</script> is a remainder term. The remainder term reminds us that in writing the Taylor expansion explicitly up to the term <script type="math/tex">\propto (x-a)^ n</script> (“up to order n”) we are omitting terms “of order <script type="math/tex">(x-a)^{n+1}</script> and higher”. 
</p>
<p>
For <script type="math/tex">x</script> close to <script type="math/tex">a</script>, we can expect the remainder term to be small (since <script type="math/tex">x-a</script> is small), so that <script type="math/tex">f(x) \simeq P_{n} (x)</script>. Thus Taylor’s theorem enables us to approximate functions by polynomials. 
</p>
<p>
In many cases the remainder term goes to zero as <script type="math/tex">n \rightarrow \infty </script> and the Taylor series expansion of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> takes the form of a possibly infinite, but convergent, series. 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]The exponential 
</p>
<p>
As an example, let us determine the Taylor series expansion of the function <script type="math/tex">f(x)=e^ x</script> about <script type="math/tex">x=0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
We first establish the necessary data. We know that we need the derivatives: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*} & & f(x)= e^ x \qquad f’(x)=\textcolor{black}{e^ x} \qquad f”(x)=\textcolor{black}{e^ x} \quad \textcolor{black}{\dots }\\ & & f(0)= \textcolor{black}{e^0 = 1 } \quad f’(0)=\textcolor{black}{e^0=1} \quad f”(0)=\textcolor{black}{e^0=1} \quad \textcolor{black}{\dots } \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Then we use this in the Taylor series expansion with <script type="math/tex">a=0</script>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \textcolor{black}{1 + x + {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^3 \over 3!} + {x^4 \over 4!} + \dots = \sum _{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} x^ n}</script></span>
<p>
Similarly, we can work out the Taylor series expansion of the function <script type="math/tex">f(x)=\cos x</script> about <script type="math/tex">x=0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
In this case, we need: 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  f(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\cos x } \  , \qquad f(0) = \textcolor{black}{1} \\ f’(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{-\sin x} \  , \qquad f’(0) = \textcolor{black}{0} \\ f”(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{ -\cos x} \  , \qquad f”(0) = \textcolor{black}{-1} \\ f”’(x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\sin x} \  , \qquad f”’(0) = \textcolor{black}{0} \\ f^{(4)} (x) & =&  \textcolor{black}{\cos x } \  , \qquad f^{(4)}(0) = \textcolor{black}{1} \\ \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 and we arrive at 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \textcolor{black}{1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} - {x^6 \over 6!} + \dots =\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ k}{(2k)!} x^{2k} }</script></span>
<p>
Finally, let us make contact with our discussion of potentials and equilibrium points. We see that the statement <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#potexp">(6.7)</a> follows immediately from Taylor’s theorem if we take <script type="math/tex">f=V</script>, <script type="math/tex">a=x_0</script> and note that <script type="math/tex">V'(x_0)=0</script> (and we neglect terms beyond quadratic order).

<h1 id="a0000000246">Collisions</h1>
<p>
As an application of the conservation of momentum, we will consider a set of problems involving the collision of two bodies. This is a common set-up in Nature, ranging from bar-room billiards to particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We will discuss the classic Newtonian problem, but also take a look at how the results change if we are dealing with velocities near the speed of light. 
</p>
<p>
In essence, we will make use of the concept of conservation of momentum, but before we do, we need to discuss what happens when momentum is <b class="bf">not</b> conserved. For this we need to introduce the idea of an <b class="bf">impulse</b>. 
</p>
<section class="section">
<h2 id="sect:impulses">7.1 Impulses</h2>
<p>
In many situations a body is subjected to a rapidly applied force, e.g., the collision of two cars, a ball hitting the wall or even a punch in the face. In such situations, the velocity of the particle changes rapidly in a short time. 
</p>

<span class="caption_ref">7.1</span>
<span class="caption_text">Short timescale, large amplitude force.</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
Consider an event where the force is applied for a brief period of time <script type="math/tex">t_1<t<t_2</script>. According to <b class="bf">N2</b> the velocity change will involve a momentum change: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}(t)=\frac{d{\vec p}}{dt}.</script></span>
<p>
 This momentum change is given by integrating both sides of <b class="bf">N2</b> to give <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec I}\equiv \int _{t_1}^{t_2}{\vec F}(t)dt={\vec p}(t_2)-{\vec p}(t_1).</script></span></span> The time integral of <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> is called the <b class="bf">impulse</b> of the force and is denoted by <script type="math/tex">{\vec I}</script>. The impulse is therefore the change in momentum of the body due to the rapidly applied force. 
</p>
<p>
When two particles collide, in general an impulsive force acts on each one. If the collision is rapid, the effect of forces acting over significantly longer timescales may be insignificant. We can then use the concepts of conservation of momentum and impulse to study the effect of the collision on the particles.

<h2 id="a0000000251">7.3 Newton’s Law of Restitution</h2>

Conservation of total momentum alone does not allow us to determine the momentum of each particle separately after the collision: it gives us but one vector equation for two vector unknowns <script type="math/tex">{\vec p_ A}^{\rm after}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\vec p_ B}^{\rm after}</script>. We need more information. 
</p>
<p>
The nature of the forces acting between the bodies depends on their material properties. A pair of steel ball bearings will rebound in a different way than say, two cars. To assess the effect of differing material properties on the collision would be (far too) complicated. Fortunately, experiment leads to a simple empirical law.

<b class="bf">Newton’s Law of Restitution</b>: When two bodies collide, their relative parting velocity in the direction of their line of contact <script type="math/tex">{\vec n}</script> (<script type="math/tex">|{\vec n}|=1</script>), is <script type="math/tex">-e</script> times their relative approaching velocity in the same direction. <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left({\vec v_ A}^{\rm after}-{\vec v_ B}^{\rm after}\right)\cdot {\vec n}=-e\left({\vec v_ A}^{\rm before}-{\vec v_ B}^{\rm before}\right)\cdot {\vec n}</script></span> </span> Note that this law contains the <b class="bf">velocities</b> and <b class="bf">not</b> the momenta of the bodies. 
</p>
<p>
The number <script type="math/tex">e</script> is an empirically determined constant that depends on the nature of the particles and encompasses the effect of their material properties on the collision. It is called the <b class="bf">coefficient of restitution</b>.

We still don’t have enough information to calculate the velocities of the bodies after the collision. The final ingredient follows from the definition of an impulse: <em>if there is no friction between the bodies</em>, no impulsive force will act perpendicular to their line of centres. Hence we deduce that, for frictionless collisions: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000256">

<h2 id="a0000000268">7.6 Centre of mass</h2>
<p>
Let us now consider what happens if the impact takes place at high velocities. In order to do this it is useful (as it simplifies the mathematics) to focus on elastic collisions<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000269">
<sup class="footnotemark">49</sup>
</a>. In general all velocities are vectors, but in order to keep the discussion simple we will consider motion in one dimension, in which case the velocities can be treated as scalars. 
</p>
<p>
Suppose we know the velocities of two particle before they collide, <script type="math/tex">v_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">v_2</script>. These are measured in the “lab frame”. If the two masses are <script type="math/tex">m_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">m_2</script> then the corresponding total (kinetic) energy is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=T_1 + T_2 = {1\over 2} m_1 v_1^2 + {1\over 2} m_2 v_2^2</script></span>
<p>
However, in many situations it is convenient to consider the problem in a different coordinate system, e.g. one that is moving along with the centre of mass. In this system, the two velocities are <script type="math/tex">u_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">u_2</script> (say) and, if the centre of mass moves with velocity <script type="math/tex">V</script>, we have the simple transformations 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_1 = v_1 - V</script></span>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_2 = v_2 - V</script></span>
<p>
 because (as we know from our everyday experience) velocities add (at least in Newtonian dynamics...). 
</p>
<p>
We determine <script type="math/tex">V</script> by demanding that the total momentum vanishes in the centre of mass frame. With the total mass <script type="math/tex">M=m_1+m_2</script> we then have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">MV = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 \  \longrightarrow \  V = { m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 \over M}</script></span>

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu = {m_1 m_2 \over M}</script></span>
<p>
We now have all the quantities we need to consider a collision in the centre of mass frame. Letting primed velocities represent the velocity of the particles after the collision, we have momentum conservation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 u_1’ + m_2 u_2’</script></span>
<p>
 and energy conservation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{1\over 2} m_1 u_1^2 + {1\over 2} m_2 u_2^2 = {1\over 2} m_1 (u_1’)^2 + {1\over 2} m_2 (u_2’)^2 \label{kencon}</script></span>
<p>
 We have two equations for two unknowns: <script type="math/tex">u_1'</script> and <script type="math/tex">u_2'</script>. We also know that in the centre of mass frame the total momentum is zero. So we actually have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = 0 \  \longrightarrow \  u_1 = - {m_2 \over m_1} u_2</script></span>
<p>
 and as the same is true after the collision; 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m_1 u_1’ + m_2 u_2’ = 0 \  \longrightarrow \  u_1’ = - {m_2 \over m_1} u_2’</script></span>
<p>
 Combining these results with the conservation of energy <a class="ref eqref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#kencon">(7.6)</a> we see that we must have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_2’ = \pm u_2 \quad \mbox{and} \quad u_1 = \pm u_1</script></span>
<p>
 For an elastic collision (and in the centre of mass frame), there are only two options. Either the particles emerge with the same velocity as before (actually, a miss!) or the directions are reversed but the speeds stays the same.

<h1 id="a0000000270">Rockets: Motion with variable mass</h1>
<p>
So far we have confined ourselves to studying the mechanics of bodies with constant mass. Let us now turn to an important variable mass problem, that of rocket motion (for which we no longer have <script type="math/tex">\vec F = m\vec a</script>). Although the mechanics is discussed in the context of a rocket, it could equally be applied to the acceleration of a jet fighter, the ascent of a balloon or even falling raindrops on a misty day. 
</p>
<p>
We consider a rocket of mass <script type="math/tex">m(t)</script> travelling at velocity <script type="math/tex">{\vec v(t)}</script> in space (i.e., free from gravity and air resistance) by emitting a jet of gas at a speed <script type="math/tex">u>0</script> relative to the rocket. At an infinitesimally later time <script type="math/tex">t+dt</script> suppose that the mass of the rocket is <script type="math/tex">m+dm</script> due to the expulsion of a mass <script type="math/tex">-dm</script> of gas through the back of the rocket.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000271">
<sup class="footnotemark">50</sup>
</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We want to use conservation of momentum to study this situation. If we denote the fixed inertial frame by <script type="math/tex">S</script>, the rocket frame by <script type="math/tex">R</script>, and the exhaust frame by <script type="math/tex">E</script>, then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v_{ES}} = {\vec v_{ER}} + {\vec v_{RS}}</script></span>
<p>
 We therefore have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec v_{ES}} = -u {\vec n} + {\vec v}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">{\vec n}</script> is a unit vector pointing in whatever direction the rocket points.

</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]Rocket speed 
</p>
<p>
Consider a rocket under gaseous propulsion in deep space, free from all external forces, travelling along the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-axis. If the initial speed of the rocket is <script type="math/tex">{\vec v_0} = v_0 {\hat i}</script>, its mass is <script type="math/tex">m_0</script> and the propulsive gases are emitted at a constant speed relative to the rocket, calculate its speed as a function of mass. 
</p>
<p>
Using the above calculation (with <script type="math/tex">{\vec n} = {\hat i}</script>) we obtain the differential equation <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\frac{dv}{dt}=-u\frac{dm}{dt}</script></span> </span> This can be converted to a separable equation by dividing through by one of the derivatives <span style="color:#000000"> <span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  m\frac{dv}{dt}\left/ \frac{dm}{dt}\right.& =& -u \quad \longrightarrow \quad m\frac{dv}{dm}=-u \\ \int dv& =& -u\int \frac{dm}{m}\quad \longrightarrow \quad v-v_0=u\ln \left(\frac{m_0}{m}\right). \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> Thus the speed depends only on the ratio of initial to current masses <script type="math/tex">(>1)</script>. Hence to get the rocket to travel quickly we need <script type="math/tex">m_0/m \gg 1</script>, i.e, to reduce the mass of the rocket by as much as possible. That’s (partly) why you have multistage rockets. Once a particular fuel tank is empty, it is jettisoned to reduce the mass as much as possible. If we want to know the speed at a particular time, we need to specify the rate of burn of rocket fuel, <script type="math/tex">dm/dt</script>, which is often a constant for most of the burn time. Suppose the rate of fuel burn for the above rocket is constant rate <script type="math/tex">-\alpha </script>. (Remember <script type="math/tex">dm</script> was negative!) 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dm}{dt}=-\alpha \Rightarrow m(t)=m_0-\alpha t</script></span>
<p>
 Hence we have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v=v_0+u\ln \left(\frac{m_0}{m_0-\alpha t}\right).</script></span></span> Note that we must have <script type="math/tex">m_0-\alpha t>0</script>, or else it will most certainly be out of fuel! 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]Rocket burn under gravity 
</p>
<p>
Suppose the above rocket is ejecting gas at a constant rate (<script type="math/tex">\alpha </script>) and at a constant velocity relative to it but is moving vertically upward in a constant gravitational field <script type="math/tex">{\vec g} = -g{\hat k}</script> (assuming that it won’t go very high...). Calculate its speed as a function of time. 
</p>
<p>
We use the full expression for <b class="bf">N2</b> <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}(m{\vec v})=({\vec v}-u{\vec n})\frac{dm}{dt}+{\vec F}</script></span> </span> where <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec F}=-m(t)g{\hat k}, \qquad {\vec v}=v(t){\hat k}, \qquad {\vec n} = {\hat k} , \qquad u={\rm constant}, \qquad \frac{dm}{dt}=-\alpha .</script></span> </span> The mass of the rocket is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dm}{dt}=-\alpha \Rightarrow m(t)=m_0-\alpha t.</script></span>
<p>
 Inserting this into the full equation and noting that only the <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script> component is relevant we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m {d\vec v \over dt} = - u \vec n {dm \over dt} + \vec F</script></span>
<p>
 If the rocket starts at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> with speed <script type="math/tex">v(0)=0</script>, then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">0=- u \ln (m_0) + {\rm constant} \Rightarrow {\rm constant}= u \ln (m_0)</script></span>
<p>
 and we then have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v= u \ln \left(\frac{m_0}{m_0-\alpha t}\right)-gt.</script></span> </span> The effect of gravity is to retard the speed of the rocket by an amount <script type="math/tex">gt</script>. Integrating once more with respect to time will give the position of the rocket.  
</p>
<p>
<br/>[width=%+10mm]A rocket with linear drag 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a slightly more involved example. The initial mass of the rocket is <script type="math/tex">m_0</script> and we still burn fuel at a constant rate, so <script type="math/tex">\dot m = - \alpha </script>. But now the rocket is subject to linear drag, <script type="math/tex">F=-\gamma v</script>, presumably because it has encountered some sticky intergalactic sludge or something. If the rocket starts from rest, how fast is it going after it has burned one half of its mass as fuel? 
</p>
<p>
With linear drag, the rocket equation becomes 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\dot v + u \dot m = - \gamma v</script></span>
<p>
 We can get a feel for what’s going on by looking at this equation. Since <script type="math/tex">\dot m = - \alpha </script>, rearranging we get 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\dot v = \alpha u - \gamma v</script></span>
<p>
 This means that we will continue to accelerate through the sticky stuff if we are travelling slowly and burning fuel fast enough so that <script type="math/tex">\alpha u > \gamma v</script>, but as our speed approaches <script type="math/tex">v=\alpha u /\gamma </script> the acceleration slows down and we expect this to be the limiting velocity. However, if we were travelling too fast to begin with, so <script type="math/tex">\gamma v > \alpha u</script>, then we will slow down until we again hit the (same) limiting speed. These expectations are brought out by the detailed solution (which follows from solving a separable equation).

<h1 id="a0000000272">Systems, solid bodies and moments</h1>
<p>
So far, we have only considered the motion of a single body. If our goal is to understand everything in the Universe, this is a bit limiting. So let us take a small step forwards and consider the dynamics of <script type="math/tex">N</script> interacting particles. 
</p>
<section class="section">
<h2 id="a0000000273">9.1 Many particles</h2>
<p>
The first thing that we do is put a label <script type="math/tex">i = 1,...,N</script> on everything<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000274">
<sup class="footnotemark">51</sup>
</a>. The <script type="math/tex">i^\mathrm {th}</script> particle has mass <script type="math/tex">m_ i</script>, position <script type="math/tex">\vec r_ i</script> and momentum <script type="math/tex">\vec p_ i = m_ i \dot{ \vec r}_ i</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Now <b class="bf">N2</b> states that, for each particle, <script type="math/tex">i=1,2, \cdots N</script>, <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m_ i{ \ddot{\vec r}}_ i(t)=\dot{\vec p}_ i = {\vec F}_ i.</script></span></span> where <script type="math/tex">\vec F_ i</script> is the force acting on the <script type="math/tex">i^{\mathrm th}</script> particle. The new thing is that, for a system of particles the force <script type="math/tex">\vec F_ i</script> can be split into two parts: an external force <script type="math/tex">\vec F^\mathrm {ext}</script> (for example, if the whole system sits in a gravitational field) and a force due to the presence of the other particles. We write 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec F_ i = \vec F_ i^{\mathrm ext} + \sum _{j\neq i} ^ N \vec F_{ij}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\vec F_{ij}</script> is the force on particle <script type="math/tex">i</script> due to the presence of particle <script type="math/tex">j</script>. This allows us to provide a more precise definition of Newton’s third law. Recall that <em>every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction</em>. This means, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec F_{ij} = -\vec F_{ji}</script></span>

<span class="caption_text">They’re absolutely everywhere!</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
We can (obviously) add all <script type="math/tex">N</script> equations to get <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum _{i=1}^{N}m_ i{ \ddot{\vec r}}_ i(t)=\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\vec F}_ i.</script></span></span> This is the equation of motion for the combined system of particles. However, it is more instructive to express the collective motion in terms of the <b class="bfseries">centre of mass</b>. Thus, we introduce the total mass: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M = \sum _{i=1}^{N} m_ i</script></span>
<p>
 and the centre of mass (generalising the previous definition in the natural way) <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec R}(t)\equiv \frac{1}{M}\sum _{i=1}^{N}m_ i{\vec r}_ i(t)</script></span> </span> The total momentum of the system, <script type="math/tex">\vec P</script>, can then be written entirely in terms of the centre of mass motion, 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec P = \sum _{i=1}^ N \vec p_ i = M \dot{\vec R}</script></span>
<p>
Let us now ask how the centre of mass moves. We have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec P} = \sum _{i=1}^ N \dot{ \vec p}_ i = \sum _{i=1}^{N} \left( \vec F_ i^{\mathrm ext} + \sum _{j\neq i} ^ N \vec F_{ij} \right) = \sum _{i=1}^{N} \vec F_ i^{\mathrm ext} + \sum _{i<j} \left( \vec F_{ij} + \vec F_{ji}\right)</script></span>
<p>
 where the last term vanishes because of <script type="math/tex">\bf N3</script>. That is, we are left with 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec P} = \sum _{i=1}^{N} \vec F_ i^{\mathrm ext}</script></span>
<p>
 This is an important result. It tells us that if we just want to know the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles, then <b class="bfseries">only the external forces count</b>. If you throw a wriggling, squealing cat then its internal forces <script type="math/tex">\vec F_{ij}</script> can change its orientation, but they can do nothing to change the path of its centre of mass. That is dictated by gravity alone. 
</p>
<p>
It is hard to overstate the importance of this result. Without it, the whole Newtonian framework for mechanics would come crashing down. After all, nothing that we really describe is truly a point particle. Certainly not a planet or a cat, but even something as simple as an electron has an internal spin. Yet none of these details matter because everything, regardless of the details, acts as a point particle if we just focus on the position of its centre of mass. 
</p>
<p>
The centre of mass can be regarded as the <b class="bfseries">average position</b> of the mass. Sometimes it is convenient to consider an extended body many up of a collection of particles as but one particle with the same total mass as the system, but located at the centre of mass<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000275">
<sup class="footnotemark">52</sup>
</a>. The idea is that the system of particles acts dynamically as if all the mass were located at the centre of mass. This is actually the idea underlying the abstraction of extended bodies into point particles that we have already been using. The centre of mass is sometimes called the <em>centre of gravity</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000276">
<sup class="footnotemark">53</sup>
</a>, and represents the point through which gravity acts in a uniform gravitational field. 
</p>
<p>
For future reference, it is also worth noting that if the system of particles is static, then <script type="math/tex">\ddot{\vec{R}}(t)={\bf 0}</script> and we must have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\vec F}_ i=0.</script></span></span> This is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the static equilibrium for a system of particles. The system may be moving with a constant velocity, but we can always make the situation stationary by viewing from an inertial frame that moves at the same velocity as the centre of mass. This is (again) the <em>centre of mass frame</em>.

<h2 id="a0000000277">9.2 Moments</h2>
<p>
If two forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, then the sum of the forces vanishes. However, if these forces do not act at the same point on a body, they exert a twist, or <b class="bf">torque</b> or <b class="bf">moment</b> about an axis.

<p>
 This torque will lead to a rotational acceleration of the body. Experimentally it is found that if the force is applied at a greater distance from the axis of rotation, then the torque/moment will be greater. In fact the moment can be determined by experiment as follows. 
</p>
<p>
Consider particle <script type="math/tex">i</script> of constant mass <script type="math/tex">m_ i</script> and suppose we decide to take the moments about the origin of the coordinate system <script type="math/tex">\cal {O}</script> and a (resultant) force <script type="math/tex">{\vec F_ i}</script> is acting on a particle located at <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}_ i(t)</script>.

If you have studied mechanics before you can now see why the magnitude of a moment is said to be “force times <i class="it">perpendicular</i> distance from the axis”.

<h2 id="a0000000280">9.4 Energy</h2>
<p>
It is also useful to consider the energy of a system of particles. The total kinetic energy is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = {1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec r} \cdot \dot{\vec r}</script></span>
<p>
 Suppose we consider the motion relative to the centre of mass, such that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r_ i = \vec R + \vec y_ i</script></span>
<p>
 then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum _ i m_ i \vec r_ i = M \vec R \  \Rightarrow \  \sum _ i m \vec y_ i = 0</script></span>
<p>
 This means that the kinetic energy can be written 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}  T = {1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \left( \dot{\vec R} + \dot{\vec y}_ i\right)^2 \\ = {1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec R}^2 + \dot{\vec R} \cdot \underbrace{ \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec y}_ i }_{=0}+ {1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec y}_ i^2 \\ = {1\over 2}M \dot{\vec R}^2 + {1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec y}_ i^2 \nonumber \end{multline}</script></span>
<p>
 Basically, the kinetic energy splits up into the kinetic energy of the centre of mass, together with the kinetic energy of the particles moving around the centre of mass.

<h2 id="a0000000281">9.5 Rigid bodies</h2>
<p>
So far, we have only discussed “particles”, objects with no extended size. But what happens to more complicated objects that can twist and turn as they move? The simplest example is a rigid body. This is a collection of <script type="math/tex">N</script> particles, constrained so that the relative distance between any two points, <script type="math/tex">i</script> and <script type="math/tex">j</script>, is fixed: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">| \vec r_ i - \vec r_ j | = \mathrm{fixed}</script></span>
<p>
 A rigid body can undergo only two types of motion: its centre of mass can move and it can rotate. We will focus on the rotation. 
</p>

<span class="caption_text">A rotating particle.</span>
</figcaption> </div>
</figure>
<p>
Suppose we fix some point in the rigid body and consider rotation about this point. To describe these rotations, we need the concept of angular velocity. We begin by considering a single particle which is rotating around the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis. The position and velocity of the particle are given by (in cylindrical coordinates) 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = ( d\cos \theta , d\sin \theta , z) \  \Rightarrow \  \dot{\vec r} = ( -d \dot\theta \sin \theta , d \dot\theta \cos \theta , 0)</script></span>
<p>
 We can write this by introducing a new vector <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega = \dot\theta \hat{ e}_ z</script>: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r} = \vec\omega \times \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 The vector <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega </script> is called the angular velocity. In general we can write <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega = \omega \hat{ n}</script>. Here the magnitude, <script type="math/tex">\omega = \dot\theta </script>, is the angular speed of rotation, while the unit vector <script type="math/tex">\hat{ n}</script> points along the axis of rotation, defined in a right-handed sense<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000282">
<sup class="footnotemark">55</sup>
</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The speed of the particle is then given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = |\dot{\vec r}| = r \omega \sin \phi = d\omega</script></span>
<p>
 where 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">d = |\hat{ n} \times \vec r| = r\sin \phi</script></span>
<p>
 is the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation. Finally, we will also need an expression for the kinetic energy of this particle as it rotates about the <script type="math/tex">\hat{ n}</script> axis through the origin; it is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = {1\over 2} m \dot{ \vec r} \cdot \dot{ \vec r}= {1 \over 2} m (\vec\omega \times \vec r) \cdot (\vec\omega \times \vec r) = {1\over 2} m d^2 \omega ^2</script></span>

<h2 id="a0000000283">9.6 The moment of inertia</h2>
<p>
Let us now consider a system with <script type="math/tex">N</script> particles which make up a rigid body. The fact that the body is rigid mean that all particles rotate with the same velocity: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r}_ i = \vec\omega \times \vec r_ i</script></span>
<p>
 This ensure that the relative distance between the particles remains fixed 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}  {d\over dt} | \vec r_ i - \vec r_ j |^2 = 2 \left(\dot{\vec r}_ i -\dot{\vec r}_ j \right) \cdot \left({\vec r}_ i -{\vec r}_ j \right) \\ = 2 \left[ \vec\omega \times \left({\vec r}_ i -{\vec r}_ j \right)\right] \cdot \left({\vec r}_ i -{\vec r}_ j \right) = 0 \nonumber \end{multline}</script></span>
<p>
We can now write the kinetic energy of a rigid body as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T={1\over 2} \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec r}_ i \cdot \dot{\vec r}_ i = {1\over 2} I \omega ^2</script></span>
<p>
 where we have introduced 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">I = \sum _{i=1}^ N m_ i d_ i^2</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">d_ i</script> is the distance of each particle away from the rotational axis. This is the <em>moment of inertia</em>. It is worth noting the similarity between the rotational kinetic energy and the translational kinetic energy (<script type="math/tex">Mv^2/2</script>) – the moment of inertia is to rotation what the mass is to translation. 
</p>
<p>
The moment of inertia also plays a role in the angular momentum. We have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec L = \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec r}_ i \times \dot{\vec r}_ i = \sum _ i m_ i \dot{\vec r}_ i \times \left( \vec\omega \times \vec r_ i \right)</script></span>
<p>
 Introducing <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega = \omega \hat{ n}</script> (with <script type="math/tex"> \hat{ n}</script> a unit vector along the rotational axis), we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}  \vec L \cdot \hat{ n} = \omega \sum _ i m_ i \left[ \vec r_ i \times ( \hat{ n} \times \vec r_ i ) \right] \cdot \hat{ n} \\ = \omega \sum _ i m_ i (\vec r_ i \times \hat{ n} ) \cdot (\vec r_ i \times \hat{ n} ) = I \omega \nonumber \end{multline}</script></span>
<p>
We already know that acting with a torque <script type="math/tex">\vec\tau </script> changes the angular momentum: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec L} = \vec\tau</script></span>
<p>
 For a rigid body, we see that if the torque is in the direction of the angular momentum (so that <script type="math/tex">\vec\tau = \tau \hat{ n}</script>) we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">I \dot\omega = \tau</script></span>
<p>
In practice, we calculate the moment of inertia by replacing the individual particles with a continuous density distribution <script type="math/tex">\rho ( \vec r)</script>. The total mass is given by the volume integral 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M = \int \rho (\vec r) dV</script></span>
<p>
 and the moment of inertia follows as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">I = \int \rho (\vec r) x_\perp ^2 dV</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">x_\perp </script> is the perpendicular distance from the point <script type="math/tex">\vec r</script> to the rotation axis. For example, for a uniform density sphere (with radius <script type="math/tex">a</script>) we would have

<h2 id="a0000000284">9.7 Why the two-body problem is really a one-body problem</h2>
<p>
Solving the general problem of the dynamics of <script type="math/tex">N</script> mutually interacting particles is (very) hard. However, when there are no external forces present, the case of two particles (labelled 1 and 2) actually reduces to the kind of one particle problem we are familiar with. 
</p>
<p>
We have already defined the centre of mass 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M \vec R = m_1 \vec r_1 + m_2 \vec r_2</script></span>
<p>
 Let us also introduce the relative separation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = \vec r_1 - \vec r_2</script></span>
<p>
 which allows us to write 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r_1 = \vec R + {m_2 \over M} \vec r \quad \mbox{and} \quad \vec r_2 = \vec R - {m_1 \over M} \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 As long as no external forces act on the system, we have <script type="math/tex">\ddot{\vec R}=0</script>. Meanwhile, the relative motion is dictated by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{\vec r} = \ddot{\vec r}_1 - \ddot{\vec r}_2 = {1\over m_1} \vec F_{12} - {1\over m_2} \vec F_{21} = { m_1 + m_2 \over m_1 m_2} \vec F_{12}</script></span>
<p>
 after using <b class="bf">N3</b>. The equation of motion can now be written 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu \ddot{\vec r} = \vec F_{12}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\mu </script> is the <em>reduced mass</em>
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu = { m_1 m_2 \over m_1 + m_2 }</script></span>
<p>
 This is nice. It means that we have already solved the problem of two mutually interacting particles because their centre of mass motion is trivial, while their relative separation reduces to the kind of problem we have already seen. 
</p>
<p>
In the limit where one of the particles involved is very heavy, say <script type="math/tex">m_2 \gg m_1</script>, then <script type="math/tex">\mu \approx m_1</script> and the heavy object remains essentially fixed, with the lighter object orbiting around it. For example, the centre of mass of the Earth and Sun is very close to the centre of the Sun. Even for the Earth and moon, the centre of mass is 1000 miles below the surface of the Earth.

<h1 id="a0000000285">Central Forces</h1>
<p>
So far our main focus has been on motion that can be described in terms of a fixed Cartesian coordinate system. This takes us quite far, but it is by no means the only way we can describe a problem. Many problems have particular symmetries and dynamical problems simplify if we make use of this. To do this, we need to introduce other sets of coordinates – and these may not be fixed. For example, we can decide to use a coordinate system that is fixed in a rotating body. Then the coordinate basis vectors will vary in time. As an example of this – and an excuse to develop the required mathematics - we will discuss the motion of particles under central forces. These are forces that act towards a central point, for example the sun or an atom.

<h2 id="a0000000286">10.1 Cylindrical Polar Coordinates</h2>
<p>
When a 3D problem has a cylindrical symmetry (a rotational symmetry about a single axis), such as the magnetic field around a wire, or the flow of fluid through a circular pipe, it makes sense to use <b class="bf">cylindrical polar coordinates</b> <script type="math/tex">(r, \theta , z)</script>, to specify the position of an object. In such situations the equations governing the system often simplify.

<span class="caption_text">Cylindrical polar coordinate system and basis vectors</span>

</figure>
<p>
Effectively these are 2D polar coordinates <script type="math/tex">(r,\theta )</script> in the <script type="math/tex">(x,y)</script> plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis, together with the usual Cartesian <script type="math/tex">z</script>-coordinate along the symmetry axis. 
</p>
<p>
The transformation from cylindrical polar coordinates to Cartesian <script type="math/tex">(r,\theta ,z)\rightarrow (x,y,z)</script> is: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=r\cos \theta , \qquad y=r\sin \theta , \qquad z=z.</script></span>
<p>
 while the inverse transformation follows from plane polar coordinates 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2},</script></span>
<p>
 with <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> being the <script type="math/tex">\arctan </script> of <script type="math/tex">\pm y/x</script>, depending on the quadrant of <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. 
</p>
<p>
For motion confined to a 2D plane <script type="math/tex">z=</script>constant, it suffices to think of these coordinates as the plane 2D polar coordinates. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of the unit Cartesian basis vectors <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}, {\hat j}, {\hat k}</script> the unit basis vectors in cylindrical polars are: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000287">
<li id="a0000000288"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> is in the outwards radial direction from the origin in the plane <script type="math/tex">z=0</script>. 
</p>
</li>
<li id="a0000000289"> <p>
<script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script> is in the azimuthal (increasing positive <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>) direction <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r\times {\hat e}_ z</script>, where

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The relationship between cylindrical polar basis vectors at the point <script type="math/tex">(r,\theta ,z)</script> and Cartesian basis vectors is given by geometry as 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  {\hat e}_ r& =& \cos \theta {\hat i}+\sin \theta {\hat j} \\ {\hat e}_\theta & =& -\sin \theta {\hat i}+\cos \theta {\hat j} \\ {\hat e}_ z& =& {\hat k} \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 In general, the position vector of a point <script type="math/tex">(r,\theta ,z)</script> in cylindrical polar coordinates is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}=r{\hat e}_ r+z{\hat e}_ z.</script></span>
<p>
 This looks crazy! We have point in 3D but only two apparent coordinates specifying it with <b class="bf">no</b> explicit behaviour on <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. This is because, as we have seen in the last point above, <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> actually depends <b class="bf">itself</b> on <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. Thus if you use a radial basis vector <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script>, you are implicitly specifying a <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. Hence the third coordinate <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> is actually there in the definition.

<h2 id="a0000000291">10.2 Velocity and Acceleration</h2>
<p>
The last point above shows that two of the unit vectors in cylindrical polars, <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script>, depend on their location <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. Hence as one moves around space in <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> the orientation of these two unit vectors changes locally, depending on the point. This does not happen for the Cartesian basis vectors <script type="math/tex">{\hat i}</script>, <script type="math/tex">{\hat j}</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat k}</script>, which are independent of the position. (Note that since <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ z={\hat k}</script> it does not change locally either.) 
</p>
<p>
Suppose we wish to represent a derived quantity, such as velocity or acceleration in cylindrical polars. When we take the derivative(s) we must be sure to take into account the fact that the basis vectors are also changing from point to point, starting with the position representation. 
</p>
<p>
Assume that the position of a particle at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> relative to an inertial frame can be represented by the cylindrical coordinates <script type="math/tex">(r(t), \theta (t), z(t)</script>). Then the vector position of the particle is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec r}=r(t){\hat e}_ r+z(t){\hat e}_ z.</script></span>
<p>
 Since <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> is a function of time, from the equation above relating polar and Cartesian bases, so will <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script>. The velocity of the particle is then given by <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}& =&  \frac{d}{dt}\left(r{\hat e}_ r\right)+\frac{d}{dt}\left(z{\hat e}_ z\right), \\ & =& \dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\hat e}_ r+\dot{z}{\hat e}_ z+z\dot{\hat e}_ z. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> But <script type="math/tex">\dot{\hat e}_ z=\dot{\hat k}={\vec0}</script> and <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \dot{\hat e}_ r& =& \frac{d}{dt}\left(\cos \theta {\hat i}+\sin \theta {\hat j}\right)=\dot{\theta }\left(-\sin \theta {\hat i}+\cos {\theta }{\hat j}\right)=\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta , \\ \dot{\hat e}_\theta & =& \frac{d}{dt}\left(-\sin \theta {\hat i}+\cos \theta {\hat j}\right) =-\dot{\theta }\left(\cos \theta {\hat i}+\sin {\theta }{\hat j}\right)=-\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_ r, \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> where the last two derivatives also use the fact that <script type="math/tex">\dot{\hat i}=\dot{\hat j}={\vec0}</script>. Hence substitution of these results into the expression for <script type="math/tex">\dot{\vec r}</script> gives <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}& =& \dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta +\dot{z}{\hat e}_ z. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> Note that unlike the position vector in cylindrical polars, the velocity vector <b class="bf">does</b> involve a <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script> component. That this is sensible follows from a qualitative description of each term in the velocity of the particle:

A particle moves in a circle of radius <script type="math/tex">R</script> in the <script type="math/tex">z=0</script> plane with position <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}</script> at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>.

<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}& =& \dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta +\dot{z}{\hat e}_ z = 0{\hat e}_ r+R\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta +0{\hat e}_ z \\ \frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}& =& R\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 It is purely tangential to the circle (as it has to be if the circular motion is to be maintained!). The acceleration of the particle in radial components is 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \frac{d^2{\vec r}}{dt^2}& =&  \left(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta }^2\right){\hat e}_ r+\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }\right){\hat e}_\theta +\ddot{z}{\hat e}_ z = \left(0-R\dot{\theta }^2\right){\hat e}_ r+r\ddot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta +0{\hat e}_ z, \\ \frac{d^2{\vec r}}{dt^2}& =& -R\dot{\theta }^2{\hat e}_ r+r\ddot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta . \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 Note that the radial component of acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle. This is called the <b class="bf">centripetal</b> (literally meaning “seeking the centre”) component of acceleration. If the particle has mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and executes the motion with a constant angular speed, i.e., 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\theta }={\rm constant}=\omega , \Rightarrow \theta =\omega t + {\rm constant},</script></span>
<p>
 then the velocity of the particle is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d{\vec r}}{dt}=R\omega {\hat e}_\theta .</script></span>
<p>
 The acceleration simplifies to only a radial component and <b class="bf">N2</b> gives the force as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d^2{\vec r}}{dt^2}=-R\dot{\theta }^2{\hat e}_ r \Rightarrow {\vec F}=-mR\omega ^2{\hat e}_ r.</script></span>
<p>
 Note that the particle is only accelerating towards the centre of the circle. The interpretation of <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script> is that it is the force that is required to keep the particle in the circular orbit of the origin. Without the presence of <script type="math/tex">{\vec F}</script>, the particle would just continue in a straight line (<b class="bf">N1</b>). If the particle is attached to hoop or a string, by <b class="bf">N3</b> there is a balancing reactive force called the <b class="bf">centrifugal</b> force.

[width=%+10mm]Motion of a plane pendulum revisited 
</p>
<p>
Suppose a pendulum of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> and fixed inextensible length <script type="math/tex">l</script> moves in a plane under the influence of gravity only, see figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figure83">10.3</a>. It is released from rest at <script type="math/tex">t=0</script> from an angle <script type="math/tex">\alpha </script> radians, where <script type="math/tex">\alpha \ll 1</script>. Analyse the motion using cylindrical polar coordinates. 
</p>
<p>
We fix coordinates with <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> pointing along the length of the string, from the suspension point to the bob. <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ z</script> passes horizontally through the suspension point, and points into the page. The motion of the bob will take place in the <script type="math/tex">z=0</script> plane. <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script> is then determined by <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r\times {\hat e}_\theta </script>. The angle <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> is fixed to be the angle of the string to the downwards vertical. The forces acting are the weight of the bob <script type="math/tex">m{\vec g}</script> and the tension <script type="math/tex">{\vec T}</script> acting along the string. <b class="bf">N2</b> gives: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m{ \ddot{\vec r}}={\vec T}+m{\vec g}.</script></span>
<p>
 In terms of cylindrical polar coordinates, resolving the force components we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec T}=-T{\hat e}_ r, \qquad {\vec g}=g\left(\cos \theta {\hat e}_ r-\sin \theta {\hat e}_\theta \right)</script></span>
<p>
 Thus <b class="bf">N2</b> becomes 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\left[\left(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta }^2\right){\hat e}_ r+\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }^2\right){\hat e}_\theta \right]=-T{\hat e}_ r+mg\left(\cos \theta {\hat e}_ r-\sin \theta {\hat e}_\theta \right)</script></span>
<p>
 Now as the string is inextensible, <script type="math/tex">r(t)=l</script>, so in component form we have 
</p>
<span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  -ml\dot{\theta }^2& =& -T+mg\cos \theta \\ ml\ddot{\theta }& =& -mg\sin \theta \end{eqnarray*}</script></span>
<p>
 For small oscillations <script type="math/tex">|\theta |\ll 1</script>, <script type="math/tex">\sin \theta \approx \theta </script> and <script type="math/tex">\cos \theta \approx 1</script> (remember <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> will be measured in radians and 1 radian <script type="math/tex">=(180/\pi )^ o</script>). Hence the last equation becomes 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot{\theta }+\frac{g}{l}\theta =0.</script></span>
<p>
 This is simple harmonic motion, just as in the case of the vertical spring. It has solution 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta (t)=C\cos \omega t + D\sin \omega t=A\cos (\omega t+B), \qquad \omega =\frac{g}{l}.</script></span>
<p>
 The initial data is <script type="math/tex">\theta (0)=\alpha </script>, <script type="math/tex">\dot{\theta }(0)=0</script> which gives <script type="math/tex">A=\alpha </script>, <script type="math/tex">B=0</script>. Thus the motion takes the form 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta (t)=\alpha \cos \omega t.</script></span>
<p>
 Note that the frequency of such small oscillations is independent of <script type="math/tex">m</script>. The tension in the string is given by the first equation above as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=mg\cos \theta +ml\dot{\theta }^2\approx m\left(g+\alpha ^2\omega ^2l\sin ^2\omega t\right).</script></span>
<p>
 If the string is elastic, or the amplitude of the oscillations is large, the problem is much more difficult!

<h2 id="a0000000309">10.4 Non-inertial frames</h2>
<p>
We know that inertial frames provide the setting for Newtonian dynamics, but what happens if you find yourself in a frame that is not inertial? We have already seen examples of this, expressed in terms of the changing basis vectors of cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Let us now consider what Newton’s equations of motion look like in non-inertial frames. In order to be explicit, we will only consider rotating frames. 
</p>
<p>
Let us start with an inertial frame <script type="math/tex">S</script> with coordinate axes <script type="math/tex">x</script>, <script type="math/tex">y</script> and <script type="math/tex">z</script> (as usual). Our goal is to understand the motion of particles as seen in a non-inertial frame <script type="math/tex">S'</script>, with axes <script type="math/tex">x'</script>, <script type="math/tex">y'</script> and <script type="math/tex">z'</script>, which is rotating with respect to <script type="math/tex">S</script>. We denote the angle between the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-axis of <script type="math/tex">S</script> and the <script type="math/tex">x'</script>- axis of <script type="math/tex">S'</script> as <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>. Since <script type="math/tex">S'</script> is rotating, we clearly have <script type="math/tex">\theta =\theta (t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\dot\theta \neq 0</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Our first task is to describe the rotation of the axes. For this, we can use the angular velocity vector <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega </script> that we introduced earlier. Consider a particle that is sitting stationary in the <script type="math/tex">S'</script> frame. Then, from the perspective of frame <script type="math/tex">S</script> it will appear to be moving with velocity 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r} = \vec\omega \times \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 where, in the present case <script type="math/tex">\vec\omega = \dot\theta {\hat e}_ z</script>. 
</p>
<p>
We can extend the description of the rotation to the axes of <script type="math/tex">S'</script> themselves. Let <script type="math/tex">\hat e_ i^\prime ,\  i = 1, 2, 3</script> be the unit vectors that point along the <script type="math/tex">x'</script>, <script type="math/tex">y'</script> and <script type="math/tex">z'</script> directions. Then these also rotate with velocity 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\hat e}_ i^\prime = \vec\omega \times {\hat e}_ i^\prime</script></span>
<p>
 This is the key result that will allow us to understand motion in rotating frames. 
</p>
<p>
Consider now a particle which is not fixed in the <script type="math/tex">S'</script> frame, but moves along trajectory. We can measure the position of the particle in the inertial frame <script type="math/tex">S</script>, where 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = \sum _ i r_ i \hat e_ i</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\hat e_ i</script> are the basis vectors of <script type="math/tex">S</script>. Alternatively, we can measure the position of the particle in frame <script type="math/tex">S'</script>, where the position is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec r = \sum _ i r_ i^\prime \hat e_ i^\prime</script></span>
<p>
 Of course, the actual position is the same in these two expressions. The coordinates differ because they are measured with respect to different axes. Let us now consider the velocity of the particle. In the fixed frame <script type="math/tex">S</script> we simply have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r} = \sum _ i \dot r_ i \hat e_ i</script></span>
<p>
 but in the rotating <script type="math/tex">S'</script> frame we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\dot{\vec r} = \sum _ i \left( \dot r_ i^\prime \hat e_ i + r_ i^\prime \dot{\hat e}_ i^\prime \right) = \sum _ i \left( \dot r_ i^\prime \hat e_ i^\prime + r_ i^\prime \vec\omega \times {\hat e}_ i^\prime \right) = \sum _ i \dot r_ i^\prime \hat e_ i^\prime + \vec\omega \times \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 Let us introduce notation to help the intuition. We write the velocity of the particle as seen by an observer in frame <script type="math/tex">S</script> as 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_ S = \sum _ i \dot r_ i \hat e_ i</script></span>
<p>
 Similarly, the velocity seen in <script type="math/tex">S'</script> is just 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_{S'} = \sum _ i \dot r_ i^\prime \hat e_ i^\prime</script></span>
<p>
 From our previous results, we then see that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_ S = \left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_{S'} + \vec\omega \times \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 The difference is (obviously) the relative velocity between the two frames. 
</p>
<p>
We can play the same game with the acceleration. This is a bit more complicated, but after a bit of algebra<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000310">
<sup class="footnotemark">56</sup>
</a>, we find that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left( {d^2 \vec r \over dt^2} \right)_ S = \left( {d^2 \vec r \over dt^2} \right)_{S'} + 2 \vec\omega \times \left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_{S'} + \dot{ \vec\omega } \times \vec r + \vec\omega \times (\vec\omega \times \vec r)</script></span>
<p>
 This relation holds the key to understanding the motion of particles in a rotating frame. 
</p>
<p>
Let us see what happens to <b class="bf">N2</b>. In the inertial frame <script type="math/tex">S</script>, we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m \left( {d^2 \vec r \over dt^2} \right)_ S = \vec F</script></span>
<p>
 This means that, in <script type="math/tex">S'</script> we have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left( {d^2 \vec r \over dt^2} \right)_{S'} = \vec F - 2 m\vec\omega \times \left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_{S'} - m\dot{ \vec\omega } \times \vec r - m\vec\omega \times (\vec\omega \times \vec r)</script></span>
<p>
 We learn that, in order to explain the motion of a particle an observer in <script type="math/tex">S'</script> must invoke the existence of three further terms on the right-hand side of <b class="bf">N2</b>. These are called <em>fictitious forces</em>. Viewed from <script type="math/tex">S'</script>, a free particle doe not travel in a straight line and these fictitious forces are necessary to explain this departure from uniform motion. The three extra terms are called the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force and the Euler force, respectively. It is worth noting that all the fictitious forces are proportional to the inertial mass <script type="math/tex">m</script>. This is because they all originated from the “ma” side of <b class="bf">N2</b>. But, the gravitational force also appears to be proportional to the inertial mass. Is this evidence that gravity is also a fictitious force? In fact it is. Einstein’s theory of general relativity recasts gravity as the fictitious force that we experience due to the curvature of space and time. 
</p>
<p>
 [width=%+10mm]Centrifugal force 
</p>
<p>
The centrifugal force is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec F_\mathrm {cent} = - m \vec\omega \times ( \vec\omega \times \vec r) = - m ( \vec\omega \cdot \vec r) \vec\omega + m \omega ^2 \vec r</script></span>
<p>
 It is easy to see that this points away from the axis of rotation. Rotating bodies want to fly out from the axis of rotation to lower their energy. 
</p>
<p>
On Earth, the centrifugal force impacts on the (local) strength of gravity. As as example of this, consider a piece of string suspended from the ceiling. You might expect the string to point down to the centre of the Earth. But the centrifugal force due to the Earth’s rotation means that this is not the case. The angle that the string makes with the line pointing to the Earth’s centre depends on the latitude, <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>, at which we are sitting. 
</p>
<p>
The effective acceleration, due to the combination of gravity and the centrifugal force, is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec g_\mathrm {eff} = \vec g - \vec\omega \times ( \vec\omega \times \vec r)</script></span>
<p>
 We can resolve this is radial and angular (Southernly) directions using unit vectors <script type="math/tex">\hat{\vec r}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\hat{\vec\theta }</script>. The centrifugal force then becomes 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec F_\mathrm {cent} = |\vec F| \cos \theta \hat{ r}+ |\vec F| \sin \theta \hat{ \theta } =m \omega ^2 r \cos ^2 \theta \hat{ r} - m \omega ^2 r \cos \theta \sin \theta \hat{ \theta }</script></span>
<p>
 At the surface of the Earth, with <script type="math/tex">r=R</script>, this leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec g_\mathrm {eff} = \left( - g + \omega ^2 R \cos ^2 \theta \right) \hat{ r} - \omega ^2 R\cos \theta \sin \theta \hat{ \theta }</script></span>
<p>
 We see that, at the equation, when <script type="math/tex">\theta = 0</script>, the string hangs directly towards the centre of the Earth, but we would measure gravity to be somewhat weaker than expected: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">g_\mathrm {eff} = g - \omega ^2 R</script></span>
<p>
[width=%+10mm]Coriolis force The Coriolis force is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec F_\mathrm {cor} = - 2 m \vec\omega \times \vec v</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\vec v</script> is the velocity measured in the rotating frame 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec v = \left( {d \vec r \over dt} \right)_{S'}</script></span>
<p>
 The force is velocity dependent: it is only felt by moving particles, but it is independent of the position. 
</p>
<p>
We can compare the Coriolis force to one of our earlier examples, that of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. This means that we already know what the effect of the force will be – it makes moving particles turn in circles. 
</p>
<p>
On Earth, the Coriolis force is responsible for the formation of hurricanes. These rotate in an anti-clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the Southern hemisphere.

<h2 id="a0000000316">10.6 Conservation of Angular Momentum</h2>
<p>
Recall that the angular momentum <script type="math/tex">{\vec L}</script> of a body at position <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}</script> with linear momentum <script type="math/tex">{\vec p}</script> about a the origin <script type="math/tex">{\cal O}</script> is <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\vec L}\equiv {\vec r}\times {\vec p}=m\left({\vec r}\times { \dot{\vec r}}\right) = m \vec l .</script></span></span> The angular momentum of a particle acted on by a central force is clearly conserved. 
</p>
<p>
Since the motion of the particle is confined to a plane and is around a central point to which the force is directed to or from, it is natural to represent the dynamics of the particle using cylindrical polar coordinates with <script type="math/tex">z=0</script>, i.e., polar coordinates in the plane (the problem is effectively two dimensional). If we write <b class="bf">N2</b> in component form in these coordinates (ignoring the constant <script type="math/tex">z</script>-component), we have <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  m{ \ddot{\vec r}}& =& mf({\vec r}){\hat e}_ r \\ \left(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta }^2\right){\hat e}_ r+\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }\right){\hat e}_\theta & =& f({\vec r}){\hat e}_ r \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{c}\left(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta }^2\right)=f({\vec r}) \\ \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }\right) = 0 \end{array}\right.</script></span></span> This equation may be integrated immediately to obtain <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">r^2\dot{\theta }=l</script></span></span> where <script type="math/tex">l</script> is a (scalar) constant. 
</p>
<p>
This is the explicit coordinate form for the conservation of angular momentum for a unit mass. To see this we write <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}\times { \dot{\vec r}}</script> in coordinate form: <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  {\vec r}\times { \dot{\vec r}}& =& r{\hat e}_ r\times \left(\dot{r}{\hat e}_ r + r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta \right) \\ & =& r\dot{r} \underbrace{\left({\hat e}_ r\times {\hat e}_ r\right)}_{\vec0} + r^2\dot{\theta } \  \underbrace{\left({\hat e}_ r\times {\hat e}_\theta \right)}_{{\hat e}_ z} \\ & =& l{\hat e}_ z={\vec l}. \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> To determine <script type="math/tex">l</script> it therefore suffices to know the position and velocity of a particle at a single point in its motion.

<h2 id="a0000000317">10.7 Conservative Central Forces</h2>
<p>
Let us now consider the implication of the conservation of energy for systems with central forces. We assume that the central force only depends on <script type="math/tex">r(t)</script>, the (scalar) distance of the body from the origin at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Then <b class="bf">N2</b> becomes 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m{ \ddot{\vec r}}=mf(r){\hat e}_ r.</script></span>
<p>
 Moreover, such central forces are conservative<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000318">
<sup class="footnotemark">58</sup>
</a> The upshot of this is that we expect <script type="math/tex">f(r)</script> to possess a potential and to generate an energy conservation law. 
</p>
<p>
In order to demonstrate this observation law we need a couple of few preliminary calculations. 
</p>
<p>
We have already seen that the motion under a central force is confined to a plane. Use this result to express the square of the speed of a body by introducing cylindrical polar coordinates. 
</p>
<p>
The velocity of a body in cylindrical polars is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{ \dot{\vec r}}=\dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta .</script></span>
<p>
 The local basis vectors <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> and <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_\theta </script> are orthogonal unit vectors. Hence, the square of the speed <script type="math/tex">v</script> of the body is given by <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">v^2={ \dot{\vec r}}\cdot { \dot{\vec r}}=\left(\dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta \right)\cdot \left(\dot{r}{\hat e}_ r+r\dot{\theta }{\hat e}_\theta \right)=\dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta }^2</script></span></span>
</p>
<p>
Next, we use the conservation of angular momentum, which means that <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dt}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }\right)=r\ddot{\theta }+2\dot{r}\dot{\theta }=0 \Rightarrow r\ddot{\theta }=-2\dot{r}\dot{\theta }</script></span></span> Hence, we have <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}r^2\dot{\theta }^2\right)=r\dot{r}\dot{\theta }^2+r^2\dot{\theta }\ddot{\theta }=r\dot{r}\dot{\theta }^2+r\dot{\theta }\left(-2\dot{r}\dot{\theta }\right)=-r\dot{r}\dot{\theta }^2.</script></span></span> We shall use this result shortly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now since <script type="math/tex">f</script> is no longer a function of <script type="math/tex">{\vec r}</script> but of <script type="math/tex">r</script> only, the <script type="math/tex">{\hat e}_ r</script> component of <b class="bf">N2</b> above becomes <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left(\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta }^2\right)=f(r).</script></span></span> If we multiply this equation through by <script type="math/tex">\dot{r}</script> we have <span style="color:#000000"><span><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{eqnarray*}  \left(\dot{r}\ddot{r}-\dot{r}r\dot{\theta }^2\right)& =& f(r)\dot{r} \\ \frac{d}{dt}\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\left(\dot{r}^2\right)\right\} +\overbrace{\frac{d}{dt}\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\left(r^2\dot{\theta }^2\right)\right\} }^{\rm using \  above \  result}& =& f(r)\frac{dr}{dt} \\ \frac{1}{2}\left\{ \dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta }^2\right\} & =& \int f(r)\frac{dr}{dt}dt+{\rm constant} \\ \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}m\left\{ \dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta }^2\right\} -\int mf(r)dr& =& E \end{eqnarray*}</script></span></span> We now identify

 and deduce that a conservation of energy equation <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T+V=E</script></span></span> holds for central forces. 
</p>
<p>
We can also use conservation of angular momentum <script type="math/tex">r^2\dot{\theta }</script> to simplify the above expression for energy further. In particular, we can remove the explicit dependence<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000319">

<h2 id="a0000000320">10.8 Circular orbits and stability</h2>
<p>
We can use the above results to discuss the boundedness of the motion. For example, the existence of a potential (<script type="math/tex">V</script>) means that it is possible to establish the existence of a stable circular orbit, by analogy with the treatment for equilibrium states in statics. 
</p>
<p>
Consider the central orbit energy equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2}m\left\{ \dot{r}^2+\frac{l^2}{r^2}\right\} +V(r)=E</script></span>
<p>
 This can be written in a form analogous to that of the the 1D equilibrium problem 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^2+U(r)=E</script></span>
<p>
 where 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">U(r)=\frac{1}{2}m\frac{l^2}{r^2}+V(r)</script></span>
<p>
 is an “effective potential”, since it combines the real potential <script type="math/tex">V(r)</script> with an extra term. The extra <script type="math/tex">l^2/r^2</script> piece is often referred to as the <em>centrifugal barrier</em>. It stops the particle from getting too close to the origin – there would be a heavy price to pay in “energy”. 
</p>
<p>
Now, the term <script type="math/tex">\tfrac {1}{2}m\dot{r}^2</script> looks like the usual 1D kinetic energy term. So we can pretend that this is a 1D system and treat the “effective potential” <script type="math/tex">U(r)</script> as the potential in which the particle moves. This is not strictly correct, since <script type="math/tex">U(r)</script> contains a term containing <script type="math/tex">l</script>, a constant that depends on the motion. However, since this term does not depend explicitly on the speed <script type="math/tex">\dot{r}</script> we can use this analogy to work out where the particle comes to rest, where the equilibrium points are, and assess their stability. 
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the analogy, we know from 1D equilibrium theory that for a stable equilibrium to exist, <script type="math/tex">U(r)</script> must have a minimum. In the context of <script type="math/tex">U(r)</script>, if such a minimum exists, it will be at a value of <script type="math/tex">r=r_0</script> say. This corresponds to a circular orbit about the central point of radius <script type="math/tex">r_0</script>.

Suppose we consider – as an example – an attractive inverse square law <script type="math/tex">f(r)=-\mu /r^2</script>. Relative to a point at infinity, this has a “proper” potential

<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(r)=+m\int _{\infty }^ r\frac{\mu }{\rho ^2}d\rho =-\frac{m\mu }{r}.</script></span>

 This gives rise to the “effective” potential: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">U(r)=\frac{ml^2}{2r^2}-\frac{m\mu }{r}</script></span>

 This has a minimum for <script type="math/tex">\mu >0</script> at 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">U’(r)=0 \Rightarrow r=r_0=\frac{l^2}{\mu }</script></span>

</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E-U(r)=\frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^2.</script></span>
<p>
 Due to the positive quantity on the right-hand side, classically allowed motion can only take place when <script type="math/tex">E-U(r)>0</script>, or <script type="math/tex">E>U(r)</script>. With this in mind we now examine the possibilities using figure <a class="ref" href="../../notes/course_notes/index.html#figure810">10.7</a>. 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000321">
<li id="a0000000322"> <p>
If the total energy of the system is <script type="math/tex">E=E_0=U(r_0)=-m\mu /2l^2</script>, then the orbit will be a stable circle with radius <script type="math/tex">r_0</script>. 
</p>

<li id="a0000000324"> <p>
If the system has energy <script type="math/tex">E_2</script> (see diagram) the system will possess no bounded orbit, and will lie in the range <script type="math/tex">r_2<r<\infty </script>.

</li>
<li id="a0000000325"> <p>
If <script type="math/tex">\mu <0</script> there is no real minimum. All orbits are unbounded, e.g., if <script type="math/tex">E=E_2</script>, the orbit will lie in the range <script type="math/tex">r_{2'}<r<\infty </script>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is also useful to ask if the orbits we determine are stable. As we are effectively dealing with a 1D problem, this is not a very tricky problem. Let us take as an example the case of circular orbits from above. We already know that we have a circular orbit if there is a solution, with <script type="math/tex">l\neq 0</script>, such that <script type="math/tex">\dot r=0</script> for all time. This means that we must have <script type="math/tex">\ddot r=0</script>, which in turn leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">U’(r)=0</script></span>
<p>
 Not surprisingly, a circular orbit corresponds to a critical point <script type="math/tex">r_0</script> of the effective potential. This orbit will be stable if a small perturbation brings us back to the original point. Basically, we have to sit at a minimum of the potential. That is, for stability we must have

Note that here we are solving for <script type="math/tex">r</script> as a function of <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>.

<h1 id="a0000000337">Analytical Dynamics</h1>
<p>
We are now going to take a slightly different approach to dynamical problems. The starting point is a formalism developed by Lagrange to represent the behaviour of mechanical systems, irrespective of the number of constituent parts or chosen coordinate systems. At the heart of the approach is the notion of energy conservation. The advantage is that this new strategy can be applied to quite complicated systems (with extensions to particle physics, general relativity etc), to derive the equations of motion, without the need for physical intuition. The underlying physical laws are not changed by this approach, but are reduced to a set of mathematical relationships between standard functions and equations, abstracted from the physical context. 
</p>
<p>
The ideas introduced here, including functions such as the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, turn up in many other areas of applied mathematics and physics, from the quantum to the astronomical scale. 
</p>
<p>
Analytical dynamics is also a powerful grounding in the more general (and abstract) theory of the dynamical systems which studies the evolution of arbitrary systems, not necessarily mechanical, as functions of their underlying governing parameters. 
</p>
<p>
The concepts of conserved quantities naturally arise here, which ultimately can lead to studies of integrable and chaotic systems (which we will not discuss).

<h2 id="a0000000338">11.1 The Calculus of Variations</h2>
<p>
Lagrange’s approach to mechanics is based on a method of deriving the equations of motion by finding the <em>minimum value</em> of an integral. This involves solving a problem in the calculus of variations. Before we consider the particular problem that arises in Lagrange’s approach to mechanics we will start by considering some more general problems in the calculus of variations. 
</p>
<p>
<br/>[width=%+10mm]The brachistochrone Consider a bead sliding under the force of gravity. The bead starts being stationary at a point <script type="math/tex">P</script> and then slides down a smooth wire to a point <script type="math/tex">Q</script>. The points <script type="math/tex">P</script> and <script type="math/tex">Q</script> are fixed and we want to find the shape of the wire that minimises the time taken for the bead to get to <script type="math/tex">Q</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Let the curve be <script type="math/tex">z=z(x)</script> (where the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis points vertically upwards), and take <script type="math/tex">P</script> to have coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x_0, z_0)</script> to <script type="math/tex">Q</script> to have coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x_1, z_1)</script>. Using the intial data at <script type="math/tex">P</script> and conservation of energy we can find the time taken to go from <script type="math/tex">P</script> to <script type="math/tex">Q</script>. We have 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = \textcolor{black}{ \int _ P^ Q \frac{dl}{v} }</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">dl</script> denotes a small element of length, measured along the wire. By conservation of energy: <span style="color:#000000"><span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">mgz_0 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgz \Rightarrow v = [2g(z_0-z)]^{1/2}</script></span></span> while 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">dl \textcolor{black}{= [(dx)^2 + (dz)^2]^{1/2} = \left[1+\left(\frac{dz}{dx}\right)^2\right]^{1/2} \,  dx }</script></span>
<p>
 We therefore obtain 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=\textcolor{black}{\int _{x=x_0}^{x=x_1} \sqrt{\frac{1+\dot z^2}{2g(z_0-z)}}\;  dx}</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\dot z= \frac{dz}{dx}</script>. 
</p>
<p>
Again the time <script type="math/tex">T</script> depends upon the function <script type="math/tex">z(x)</script> and is again a functional 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=T[z]</script></span>
<p>
The problem is then to find <script type="math/tex">z(x)</script> with <script type="math/tex">z(x_0)=z_0</script> and <script type="math/tex">z(x_1)=z_1</script> so that <script type="math/tex">T</script> is minimised. The general solution to the problem of finding the brachistochrone, or curve of quickest descent, was first found by J Bernoulli in 1696 who showed that it was a cycloid.

<h2 id="a0000000339">11.2 The Euler-Lagrange Equations</h2>
<p>
In essence, we have to minimise an integral that depends upon some function and its derivatives and has fixed end points. We therefore now consider the general case of a functional<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000340">
<sup class="footnotemark">62</sup>
</a> that depends upon <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> and has the form <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">I[x]=\int _{t=t_0}^{t_1} f(x(t), \dot x(t), t)dt</script></span> </span> where <script type="math/tex">f(\cdot , \cdot , \cdot )</script> is a given function and <script type="math/tex">\dot x=\frac{dx}{dt}</script>. 
</p>
<p>
The function <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> is taken to be fixed at the end points of the integral <script type="math/tex">x(t_0)=x_0</script> and <script type="math/tex">x(t_1)=x_1</script> and is required to be twice differentiable. We then want to find an expression for <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> which minimises the functional <script type="math/tex">I[x]</script>. 
</p>
<p>
In order to find <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> it is useful to suppose we have (somehow) found an <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> which minimises <script type="math/tex">I[x]</script> and then consider what happens “near” that function. Consider some nearby function <script type="math/tex">\tilde x(t)</script> which is ‘close to’ <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script>. We can construct a general expression for such nearby functions <script type="math/tex">\tilde x(t)</script> as follows. Let <script type="math/tex">\eta (t)</script> be a twice differentiable function (it has a continuous second derivative) defined for <script type="math/tex">t_0 \leq t \leq t_1</script> which also satisfies the conditions 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\eta (t_0)=0, \quad \eta (t_1)=0.</script></span>
<p>
 We call such a function <script type="math/tex">\eta </script> a variation. Then we can define a one parameter family of functions <script type="math/tex">\tilde x</script> close to <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> by using the variation <script type="math/tex">\eta </script> to define <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde x(t)=x(t) + \epsilon \eta (t)</script></span> </span> where <script type="math/tex">\epsilon </script> is a small parameter. 
</p>
<p>
We now consider some fixed variation <script type="math/tex">\eta (t)</script> and see how <script type="math/tex">I[\tilde x(t)]</script> varies with <script type="math/tex">\epsilon </script>. Hence we consider the function <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\phi (\epsilon )=I[x(t)+\epsilon \eta (t)]</script></span> </span> Since <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> gives a minimum for <script type="math/tex">I[x(t)]</script> it follows that <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">I[x(t)+\epsilon \eta (t)] \geq I[x(t)]</script></span> </span> and hence 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\phi (\epsilon ) \geq \phi (0)</script></span>
<p>
 Using results from the calculus of a function of one variable we see that in order that <script type="math/tex">\epsilon =0</script> is a minimum we must have <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d\phi }{d\epsilon }(0)=0</script></span> </span> More generally if the above equation is true for all possible choices of variation <script type="math/tex">\eta (t)</script> we say that <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> is a stationary value of <script type="math/tex">I[x(t)]</script>. 
</p>
<p>
We now use the definition of <script type="math/tex">\phi (\epsilon )</script>, and the fact that <script type="math/tex">\epsilon =0</script> is a minimum of <script type="math/tex">\phi (\epsilon )</script> to find equations that <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> must satisfy.

The advantages of the Lagrangian method become more obvious if we consider a problem with several degrees of freedom<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000345">
<sup class="footnotemark">65</sup>
</a>. We start by considering the motion of a particle moving in three dimensions under the action of a potential <script type="math/tex">V</script>.

<p>
Then the kinetic energy is

We have established the following result: 
</p>
<ul class="itemize" id="a0000000346">
<li id="a0000000347"> <p>
Newton’s equations for a particle acted on by a force due to a potential <script type="math/tex">V</script> are equivalent to the Lagrange equations of motion, which give the motion of the particle which minimises the action <script type="math/tex">I</script>. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 In other words, one can derive Newton’s laws of motion from the <i class="it">principle of least action</i> (sometimes called Hamilton’s principle). In fact the principle of least action is more fundamental than Newton’s laws. As well as being used to derive the equations of motion for a particle it can be used to derive the equations of motion for a field. For example Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism can be derived from the principle of least action as can Einstein’s general relativistic field equations. 
</p>
<p>
The big advantage of the principle of least action as far as mechanics is concerned is that it is true in <i class="it">any</i> coordinate system, since the Lagrangian is a <i class="it">scalar</i> that only depends on the motion of the particle not the coordinates used to describe it. 
</p>
<p>
Let us illustrate this by obtaining the equations of motion for a particle moving in the plane but using polar coordinates <script type="math/tex">(r, \theta )</script> to describe the motion rather than the usual Cartesian coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x,y)</script>. 
</p>
<p>
The first step is to obtain a formula for the kinetic energy in plane polar coordinates.

</p>
<p>
Hence the Euler-Lagrange equation for the <script type="math/tex">r</script> variable <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot r}\right)- \frac{\partial L}{\partial r}=0</script></span> </span> gives <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot r-mr\dot\theta ^2+\frac{\partial V}{\partial r}=0</script></span> </span> or

<p>
 which may be shown to be the component of Newton’s equation in the radial direction (by using vectors and resolving). The <script type="math/tex">r\dot\theta ^2</script> term is the ‘centripetal acceleration’ term from before. 
</p>
<p>
To find the <script type="math/tex">\theta </script>-equation we again just look at the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\theta }=m r^2\dot\theta</script></span> </span> so that <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\theta }\right)= mr^2\ddot\theta +2mr\dot r\dot\theta</script></span> </span> Note that this contains two terms because both <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">\dot\theta </script> depend upon <script type="math/tex">t</script>.

<br/>[width=%+10mm]The pendulum 
</p>
<p>
As a first example, consider a simple pendulum. In this case the kinetic energy is given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\theta ^2)=\frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot\theta ^2</script></span>
<p>
 since <script type="math/tex">r=l</script> and <script type="math/tex">\dot r=0</script>, while the potential energy is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V=mgh=mgl(1-\cos \theta )</script></span> </span> Hence the Lagrangian is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">L=\frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot\theta ^2-mgl(1-\cos \theta )</script></span> </span> We now calculate the Lagrange equations of motion <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\theta }=ml^2\dot\theta , \quad \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\theta }\right)=ml^2\ddot\theta , \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta }=-mgl\sin \theta</script></span> </span> so that <script type="math/tex">ml^2\ddot\theta +mgl\sin \theta =0</script> or <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot\theta +\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta =0</script></span> </span> One cannot solve this differential equation in closed form (without introducing so-called elliptic functions). However for small <script type="math/tex">\theta </script> we have <script type="math/tex">\sin \theta \approx \theta </script>, so that for small oscillations the equation is approximately given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot\theta +\frac{g}{l}\theta =0</script></span>
<p>
 writing <script type="math/tex">g/l=\omega ^2</script> we recognise this as simple harmonic motion with angular frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega </script> so that the general solution is 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta (t)=A\cos (\omega t)+B\sin (\omega t), \quad \hbox{where}\quad \omega =\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}</script></span>
<p>
 So that the motion of the pendulum is described by oscillations about <script type="math/tex">\theta =0</script> with period <script type="math/tex">\tau =2\pi \sqrt{l/g}</script>.  
</p>
<p>
<br/>[width=%+10mm]Mass on a spring 
</p>
<p>
Another example is a mass on a spring. Let <script type="math/tex">x</script> be the extension of the spring. The the force due to the spring is <script type="math/tex">F=-kx</script>, where <script type="math/tex">k</script> is the spring constant. Hence the potential energy stored in the spring is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V_{\hbox{spring}}=\frac{1}{2}k x^2</script></span> </span> The gravitational potential energy is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V_{\hbox{grav}}=-mgx</script></span> </span> So that the total potential energy is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V=\frac{1}{2}k x^2-mgx</script></span> </span> The kinetic energy of the mass is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T=\frac{1}{2}m v^2=\frac{1}{2}m \dot x^2</script></span> </span> Hence the Lagrangian for this problem is <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">L= \frac{1}{2}m \dot x^2 -\frac{1}{2}k x^2+mgx</script></span> </span> We now calculate the Lagrange equation of motion <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x}=m\dot x, \quad \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x}\right)=m\ddot x, \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=-kx+mg</script></span> </span> So that <span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x}\right)- \frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0</script></span> </span> gives 
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#000000"> <span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">m\ddot x+kx-mg=0</script></span> </span> or 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ddot x+\frac{k}{m}x=g</script></span>
<p>
 That is, we have recovered the usual result and we know that the mass oscillates about the equilibrium position <script type="math/tex">x=mg/k</script> with angular frequency <script type="math/tex">\omega =\sqrt{k/m}</script>.  
</p>
<p>
<br/>[width=%+10mm]Planetary motion 
</p>
<p>
Lagrangian methods provide a very easy way of deriving the equations of motion of a small particle in the gravitational field of a much larger one, e.g. the motion of a planet around the Sun. We can assume that the planet’s motion is confined to a plane containing the Sun, and use plane polar coordinates <script type="math/tex">(r,\phi )</script> to label its position. The planet then has velocity 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\boldsymbol v} = \textcolor{black}{ \dot r {\boldsymbol e_ r} + r\dot\phi {\boldsymbol e_\phi } }</script></span>
<p>
 where a dot denotes a time derivative and <script type="math/tex">{\boldsymbol e_ r}, {\boldsymbol e_\phi }</script> are unit vectors in the radial and angular directions. The planet’s kinetic energy is then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = \textcolor{black}{ \frac{1}{2} m (\dot r ^2 + r^2\dot\phi ^2) }</script></span>
<p>
 The potential energy in this case is gravitational potetial energy, which Newton took to be given by the equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V = \textcolor{black}{ -\frac{GMm}{r} }</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">M</script> is the mass of the Sun (assumed fixed in space), <script type="math/tex">m</script> the mass of the planet, and <script type="math/tex">G</script> is Newton’s gravitational constant. Note that this leads to a force <script type="math/tex">{\boldsymbol F}</script> given by 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\boldsymbol F} = -\nabla V = \textcolor{black}{ -\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} {\boldsymbol e_ r} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} {\boldsymbol e_ r} ,}</script></span>
<p>
 This is the famous “inverse square law”. 
</p>
<p>
The Lagrangian is then 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">L = T - V = \textcolor{black}{ \frac{1}{2} m (\dot r ^2 + r^2\dot\phi ^2) + \frac{GMm}{r} }</script></span>
<p>
 The radial Euler-Lagrange equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot r} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad \longrightarrow \quad \textcolor{black}{ \frac{d}{dt} (m\dot r) = mr\dot\phi ^2 - \frac{GMm}{r^2} \Rightarrow \ddot r = r\dot\phi ^2 - \frac{GM}{r^2} }</script></span>
<p>
 while the angular Euler-Lagrange equation 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\phi } = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi } \quad \longrightarrow \quad \textcolor{black}{ \frac{d}{dt}(mr^2\dot\phi ) = 0 }</script></span>
<p>
These are two coupled ordinary differential equations which can then be solved to give <script type="math/tex">r(t)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\phi (t)</script>, although the solution cannot be written in simple form. Note that the angular equation particularly simple: the particle’s angular momentum is given by (we will use <script type="math/tex">J</script> for the angular momentum to avoid confusion with the Lagrangian) 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\boldsymbol J} = \textcolor{black}{ {\boldsymbol r} \times {\boldsymbol p} = r{\boldsymbol e_ r} \times m (\dot r{\boldsymbol e_ r} + r\dot\phi {\boldsymbol e_\phi }) = mr^2 \dot\phi {\boldsymbol e_ r} \times {\boldsymbol e_\phi } }</script></span>
<p>
 A little thought shows that for points in the <script type="math/tex">z=0</script> plane where our planet resides, <script type="math/tex">{\boldsymbol e_ r} \times {\boldsymbol e_\phi } = {\boldsymbol e_ z}</script>, so that 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\boldsymbol J} = \textcolor{black}{ mr^2\dot\phi {\boldsymbol e_ z} \hspace{3mm} \Rightarrow \hspace{3mm} J = mr^2\dot\phi }</script></span>
<p>
 i.e. the angular Euler-Lagrange equation is simply <script type="math/tex">J =</script>constant (as expected from the discussion of central forces). The particle’s energy is: 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">E = T + V = \textcolor{black}{ \frac{1}{2} m (\dot r ^2 + r^2\dot\phi ^2) - \frac{GMm}{r} }</script></span>
<p>
 Eliminating <script type="math/tex">\dot\phi </script> in favour of <script type="math/tex">J</script> leads to 
</p>
<span class="dmath"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat E = \textcolor{black}{ \frac{1}{2} \left(\dot r^2 + \frac{\hat J^2}{r^2}\right) - \frac{GM}{r} }</script></span>
<p>
 where <script type="math/tex">\hat E = E/m</script> and <script type="math/tex">\hat J = J/m</script>, the energy and angular momentum of the particle per unit mass.

<li id="a0000000314">Due to the extremely weak nature of gravity <script type="math/tex">G</script> is still one of the least accurately known fundamental constants.</li>
<li id="a0000000318">This can be checked by writing <script type="math/tex">\nabla </script> in polar coordinates and showing that the curl of <script type="math/tex">f(r){\hat e}_ r</script> vanishes.</li>
<li id="a0000000319">Recall that <script type="math/tex">l = r^2 \dot\theta </script>.</li>
<li id="a0000000328">So we are making contact with a classic bit of geometry.</li>
<li id="a0000000331">Yes, this is worth sniggering at.</li>
