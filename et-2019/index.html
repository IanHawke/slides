							GW170817 is the ony fully confirmed and checked GW signal of a BNS merger. In a staggering stroke of luck only seen when thousands collaborate over decades, the strongest GW signal yet detected was the (relatively) close merger of two neutron stars, giving us strong field information about their interior physics.
							<br>
							A crucial point to note here is that LIGO has observed the merger from about 50 up to 500 Hz: in principle we expect the signal to span from tens to a few thousands of Hz.

							Getting more information about the properties of matter in extreme situations is one key purpose of GW observations of NS mergers. Much of this information is expressed through the <i>equation of state</i>, a short-hand for how the microscopic properties affect large scale observables (for example, how the hydrodynamic pressure depends on density and temperature). The mass information doesn't tell us anything that wasn't known from pulsars, but the radius information is much harder to get that way. Information about the tidal compressibility, via the Love numbers, put constraints on the equation of state that are complementary to that from pulsar observations.

							This figure is from one of the Einstein Telescope design studies, overlaying expected GW signals on various detector noise curves. It emphasizes how lucky GW170817 was - that was at around 40Mpc, whereas here we're looking at the expected distance of 300Mpc. The key point is that it's the inspiral phase that hits the sweet spot of LIGO's noise curve. The higher frequency part of the signal is practically unobservable with LIGO; we'd need better detectors to get those.
							<br>
							The Einstein Telescope is one such third generation detector; that's likely at least 20 years in the future. LIGO is good enough for the inspiral: to get more information about the physics we'll need either to wait, or do something else.

							Multi messenger is going to be the key approach until third generation detectors come online. Using complementary observation channels we can get further information to constrain the microscopic properties. This isn't new: neutrino and EM observations have been combined for studies of the sun, and for supernovae. By including GWs we're getting constraints on the coupling between gravity and matter. It's hard to do: localising the source just from GWs is tricky with so few detectors, especially fast enough (even with GW170817 the first trigger was in $\gamma$!), but improving the network will help (eg, LIGO India).
							<br>
							For GW170817 there's a wealth of information about the post-merger regime, particularly the jet pushed out by the kilonova and the products left over. This gives some weak constraints on the constituents of the progenitor NSs. These constraints will be strengthened by further observations in O3 and beyond: was Sunday's event (1st September) another BNS merger?

							The inspiral phase is driven by the spacetime effects. There's practially no interaction between the NSs until the very final phase (but see the part about the crust later!). So the crucial quantities and leading order in the stress-energy, and we can write them down quite simply: total mass-energy (through baryon mass and magnetic fields), compactness, and (for longer inspirals) the effects of spin and eccentricity. This is very close to the situation for BHs.
							<br>
							From this we can determine the key numbers for numerical simulations. We saw from the plots for GW170817 that the GW frequencies run from tens to thousands of Hz. If we focus on the last fractions of a second, where the frequencies are in the hundreds of Hz and which are all we can practially simulate, then that corresponds to a gravitational wavelength of order $10^6$ m. To get enough GWs into our grid to measure we'll need multiple wavelengths, so a grid boundary at order $10^7$ m.
							<br>
							Similarly, we know that the NS radius is of order $10^4$ m. We'll need many tens of points across the radius to accurately capture the behaviour over the timescale of the merger, leading to a grid spacing of order $100$ m. Causality leads to the stability constraint (CFL!) meaning the timestep can't be bigger than $10^{-6}$ s. For evolving say $10$ ms that's $10^4$ steps at best.

The work of Shibata and collaborators sets much of the standards and we can see how the early test simulations which don't meet the required standards for LIGO are now replaced by simulations definitely good enough for second generation detectors.

							It's worth noting that at around this time the work of the Binary NS and BH Grand Challenges were bearing fruit, with the open GR3D code leading, through Mark Miller's MAHC code and the EU Network Whisky code, to the GRHydro code that's available through the ETK today.

							As we move to higher resolution we have to look at the NS modelling. Here are images from Page and Steiner looking at some of the additional physics that are going to have some level of impact on the observed signals. There's the crust and the layered nature of the star. There's the magnetic field, which has to consistently extend through the interior to the exterior. There's the exotic particles in the core, and the superfluid neutron fluids. There's a wealth of complex interactions with emitted radiation. A lot of these effects happen on short length or timescales so are unlikely to impact the inspiral, but the multi messenger post-merger signals will crucially depend on these details.

							In the outer layers it's energetically favourable for the neutrons to form a lattice. The effects on the bulk motion are small - for example, the Love numbers (and hence tidal compressibility) change at the sub-percent level. However, the magnetic field is expected to be tightly bound to the crust, and mismatches between crustal and core motion and expected to generate observable signals. This is seen in pulsars via glitches; Tsang has suggested that inspiral resonances may shatter the crust leading to EM observable signals, giving detailed EOS information.

							To simulate this we'll need a formulation and $\Delta x \sim 10$ m.

Going beyond ideal MHD is needed to consistently connect the interior and exterior of the NS, obviously needed for multi-messenger: it's likely that the lengthscales involved here are of the order of $1$ m, making things tricky.

							There remains some dispute that effects that, on earth, are micro-scale quantum level with small-scale macro effects, like superconductivity and superfluidity, even exist on the kilometre lengthscales of a NS. However, it's strongly believed that Cooper pairing will lead to some part of the outer core and inner crust over a radius of at least metres will contain these effects. This has crucial for angular momentum transport - the quantization of rotation is inherent, and also leads to anisotropic heat transport and could have a massive effect of cooling of the remnant.
							<br>
							However, consistent hydrodynamic theories of, eg, superfluids, involve multiple inter-penetrating fluids with their own velocity vectors. The lengthscales could be relevant for all simulations - the flux tubes and vortices could stretch across the whole NS! - but the timescales where things relax could be extremely short.

							Starting from stress-energy conservation we can choose a tetrad, typically aligned with the coordinates, to get four balance laws. The crucial point is the total divergence on the left-hand-side. First order hyperbolic PDEs of this form are well studied, and there's good numerical methods to solve them.

							However, for astrophysically interesting matter we're going to need more than four fields to describe it. The conserved quantities (the ${\bf q}$'s) are roughly the energy and momentum of the average flow. We'll also need to describe EM fields, radiation, temperature and particle number by additional fields. These may be in balance law form, but may not (as seen in the multifluid section).

								Example of magnetic resistivity:
								<ul>
									<li>
										width of features depends on resistivity;

									<li>
										source terms "stiff": stability of full model requires $\Delta t \sim \sigma^{-1}$;

								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Non-ideal effects are usually very small. Unfortunately, "usually" is not good enough: the NS surface, for example, depends crucially on non-ideal effects. In the "full" non-ideal models the additional terms usually come in through the sources, and are often "stiff": that is, they react by trying the "push" the system back to an equilibrium, and they do this on very fast timescales. That's problematic, as the evolution needs to resolve these short/fast scales in order to remain stable.
							<br>
							This example is from resistive MHD. If ideal MHD were used then the "islands" of magnetic pressure should stay separate. By including resistivity magnetic reconnection causes them to interact, with the width of the boundary layer linked to the resistivity value. As we get closer to "real" values of the resistivity you can see the connection region getting very thin.

						<aside class="notes">
							There are two approaches to the stiffness problem. One is to use implicit numerical methods. This allows us to evolve the full model, stably, but has significant computational costs - in these examples it's usually an order of magnitude, and for real values it will only get worse.
							<br>
							The alternative is to approximate the model, which we do here by a perturbation expansion about the ideal MHD limit. This "Chapman-Enskog" expansion was designed for the Boltzmann equation, so has broader relevance. The performance is much better than the implicit methods, but there are some stability issues: the approximation is only stable for certain resolutions.

							For simulating the crust we need the equations of motion for elastic matter (more realistic plastic flow probably not needed for mergers, and is conceptually hard to formulate). It's determined by the stress-energy tensor which looks like that of a perfect fluid plus an anisotropic pressure term. However, the equation of state depends on the strain, and measuring that requires comparing the matter configuration to its "relaxed" state in a covariant way. This requires evolving and using a map taking spacetime quantities to the reference space.

There's a lot more freedom here, and the inter-fluid interactions (which are needed to model, eg, superfluids or causal heat theories) lead to entrainment terms. This is where the interactions with one fluids momentum drags the other fluid along: momenta and velocities need not be aligned.
							<br>
							Crucially with entrainment we don't necessarilly have a balance law form.

							This multifluids example comes from a very simple investigation of the two-stream instability, where physically we expectthe interactions between the fluids to be driven unstable. This is a very simple numerical scheme which means it can't handle shocks. Despite this, the computational cost is extreme: the multiple fluids increases the state vector considerably, and the conservative to primitive transformation is not just multi-dimensional but also requires solving a linear system as part of each internal step.
							<br>
							To make multifluid simulations useful for mergers we need better numerical methods that can deal with formulations not in balance law forms. Such methods exist - typically referred to as path-consistent methods - but rely crucially on an understanding of the <em>physical</em> dissipation to add. That's where we're lacking.

								<li>Existing codes like `GRHydro` focus on (M)HD.
								<li>Good enough for LIGO - get bulk motion of matter right.
								<li>For multi messenger need to add physics on shorter/faster scales.
								<li>Many directions to work on!

							I've only covered a few of the directions that numerical simulations may go in order to get ready for multi messenger simulations. There's a lot I haven't touched on that's crucial - radiation transport for evolutions, and the whole area of constructing initial data. Building this into the Einstein Toolkit will require adding complexity, particularly when the physics it tightly coupled: to make this practical, key thorns (like `GRHydro`!) should first be simplified!
