# Numerical methods in GR

## Abstract

The "best" numerical methods depend on the model being simulated, the accuracy needed, and the resources available. This talk will survey the methods currently used across the field, particularly those available through the Einstein toolkit. The links for the next generation of simulations between numerical methods, models of the matter and spacetime, and near-future computing hardware will also be explored.
