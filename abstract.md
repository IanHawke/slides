# Science opportunities enabled by next generation gravitational wave observatories

Next generation gravitational wave detectors will be sensitive to the post-merger phase of binary neutron star mergers. This has the potential to constrain matter properties beyond the cold equation of state, probing finite temperature, nuclear reaction, neutrino and non-ideal transport effects. However, the exceptionally messy and nonlinear nature of the system post-merger makes nonlinear numerical simulations essential. This talk will briefly highlight current issues with nonlinear simulations that may limit what we can say about the post-merger details, and potential strategies needed to overcome them.
