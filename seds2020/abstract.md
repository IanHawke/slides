Title : Gravitational waves, neutron stars, and numerical simulations

## Abstract

In 2017 two neutron stars merged over 100 light years away. Observed by both gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors, this one event gave us a huge amount of information about gravity and particle physics. However, detailed modelling was needed to even make a detection, and is essential for interpreting the results. This talk will outline the modelling needed for full numerical simulations of neutron star mergers, and what we need to improve for future detections.
