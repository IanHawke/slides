							The motivation behind this talk is the merger of two neutron stars, which I'll illustrate with snapshots from this movie from a series of simulations by Bruno Giacomazzo and collaborators. <br>
							A neutron star has more mass than our sun, compressed to a radius of around 10km. They're the densest objects in the universe except for black holes. That means they can rotate incredibly fast - thousands of times per second, leading to huge magnetic fields - up to 16 orders of magnitude larger than the sun. When two neutron stars merge it's a very violent astrophysical event which can be observed in many ways from huge distances, telling us about matter in extreme situations. <br>
							Neutron stars in orbit about each other move quickly. Shortly before they merge, as here, the orbital frequency will be hundreds of Hertz. Massive objects moving quickly generate <i>gravitational waves</i>: ripples in spacetime that carry energy away to distant observers. As energy is emitted the stars spiral in until they merge. <br>
							At this point things get messy. When the stars smash into each other a shock propagates through the merged object, massively increasing the temperature. At the same time the magnetized material "slips" past its companion, winding up the total magnetic field in a dynamo effect. <br>
							The remnant tries to settle down, with some material expelled from the system. But the object is too massive to support itself, and at around 30ms the core collapses to a black hole. Most of the dense matter is rapidly swallowed into the black hole, leaving a small fraction at larger radius to settle into a disk. It's believed that, when this remaining matter collapses back on the black hole, some matter is heated and expelled along the magnetic axis in a jet, which can also be observed in the electromagnetic spectrum.
							<br>
							We see that we need to model the fluid interior and the vacuum exterior. We need to model the shock as the stars smash together, and the resulting jump in temperature. We need to model the small scale structure in the interior as the magnetic fields wind up, forming the precursor to the jet. And we need to do this on top of evolving the spacetime, tracking any black holes that might appear.
							<br>
							For this talk I'm going to focus on the magnetic field evolution and structure. This is crucial in determining if and when the matter collapses to a black hole, and so what the observable signatures are.
							<br>
							Before I go on, I should highlight some features of the numerical schemes used here. The movie isn't showing the whole domain: in fact it's showing less than 1% of the domain in any direction. We need to push the boundaries a long way out so the gravitational waves settle down and can be measured on the grid in a comparable fashion to how they'd be detected by us. This means many levels of mesh refinement are needed, usually at least 8. To get sufficient accuracy of the waves the spacetime evolution uses high order central differencing, and to minimize dispersion effects the mesh refinement is "box-in-box" style, with few grids per level, each containing many points. This has a knock-on effect on the hydro and MHD algorithms preferred. Whilst HRSC schemes are still needed, there's a bias in the field to high spatial orders with more diffusive flux solvers, which capture the bulk features accurately whilst being stable enough at shocks. This simulation used a high-order PPM variant with HLL-style flux solver; some simulations shown later will use a Lax-Friedrichs flux splitting with WENO differencing.

									<li> (Also solve for spacetime - $\gtrsim 10$ wave equations - and fluid.)
								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							Now, solving the Maxwell equations is nothing new - there's great work being done within your own group on this. There are, however, additional issues when you add relativity, which we illustrate by writing the Maxwell equations in special relativity and writing out the charge current including the simplest scalar resistivity, as here. The velocity, $v^i$, is given by evolving the fluid - think of this like the standard Euler equations, although there are some relativistic issues there too. The Lorentz factor, $W$, is determined by the velocity - it essentially encodes the length contraction due to the fluid moving at relativistic speeds. <br>
							The relativistic velocities mean that there can be a large difference between the fluid frame and the observer frame, leading to the charge current being large. The strong coupling through the Lorentz factor makes it tricky to simplify this equation further. That means that, unless we can work in specific limits, we have to solve the full system. <br>
							The obvious limit to work in is the ideal limit where the scalar resistivity $\eta$ vanishes. This fixes the electric field in terms of the velocity and magnetic field, and we're back to MHD. Nearly all simulations of neutron stars have used the MHD approximation. This isn't just numerical convenience: there are papers arguing that the resistivity will be so small - $\eta \ltsim 10^{-16} \text{s}$ - that it's totally negligible. <br>
							However, even small resistivity can lead to large qualitative changes in magnetic field <i>configurations</i>, which can be seen by looking at helicity arguments. So there's interest in studying the near-ideal limit. Unfortunately this limit is <i>stiff</i>: the current, which gives the source term for the electric field, is large and can change on very short scales. <br>
							A couple of brave groups have tackled this full problem. To get around the stiffness issue they've used implicit solvers. Specifically, they've used the Implicit-Explicit, or IMEX solvers, to do the time update. This has worked in test cases, but the resistivities used to date have been at least six orders of magnitude too large, and the simulations are an order of magnitude slower than the ideal case. Using physically meaningful parameter values isn't possible with IMEX schemes as yet.

								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							When Alex and I started looking at this problem we found this toy problem in LeVeque's red book, that was proposed by Liu back in the 1980's. Here $u, v$ are scalar fields. In the limit where the small parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero the second equation becomes a constraint, forcing $v$ to be $f(u)$. That means we end up with a single conservation law, simplifying the system. <br>
							The case we're interested in is where $\epsilon$ is small but not zero. This is known as a relaxation system as the fast variable $v$ is expected to rapidly evolve so that $v$ is close to $f(u)$, whilst $u$ is expected to evolve slowly. To take advantage of this behaviour we can do a perturbation expansion, where $v$ takes its equilibrium value $f(u)$ to leading order in $\epsilon$, but has a correction term at first order. <br>
							This <i>Chapman-Enskog</i> expansion can be used to again eliminate the second equation in the system. However, the full system is needed to get an expression for the correction term $v_1$. On plugging in the correction we no longer have a conservation law. We now have a source term which needs the second derivative of our slow variable $u$. <br>
							This new system is not exact, but is an approximation for small $\epsilon$. It has a number of crucial advantages for our problem. <br>
							First, it's reduced the size of the system. In fact, when applied to resistive MHD, we'll eliminate the evolution equation for the electric field, and evolve exactly the same variables as in <i>ideal</i> MHD. This makes modifying an existing code to cover resistivity a lot more straightforward. <br>
							Second, our system is no longer stiff in the limit of small $\epsilon$. Applied to resistive MHD, it means it's not stiff in the limit of small resistivity. This means we can use explicit time integrators rather than IMEX schemes. Together, these advantages will speed up resistive evolutions to make them practical for neutron star mergers. <br>
							However, as there's never a free lunch, there must be balancing disadvantages. The most important is numerical stability from the choice of timestep. We're used to setting the timestep from the CFL condition, so proportional to the grid spacing. However, standard von Neumann stability analysis for a simple heat equation suggests that the parabolic or diffusive correction term will lead to a timestep restriction that is proportional to the square of the grid spacing. <br>
							Whether this approach is useful depends on the proportionality constants in these timestep restrictions. We take the viewpoint that we're always going to want to use the timestep from the hyperbolic CFL limit. This means that there is a minimum grid spacing that we can use. Below this grid spacing the parabolic time step restriction will be violated and the method unstable. We can approximately locate this critical minimum grid spacing analytically, but it's best determined by numerical experiments.

							The first test is one dimensional and standard: by keeping all the hydro variables constant with zero velocity, the resistive equations boil down to a heat equation, with the standard error function solution that slowly diffuses with time. <br>
							We show the result for three conductivities, remembering that the conductivity $\sigma$ is the inverse of the resistivity $\eta$. The values we're using here are a long way away from the astrophysical regime: they were chosen as we can practically solve the full resistive system using IMEX methods for these values. As such they're a hard test for the perturbation expansion. Despite this there is excellent agreement between the full resistive results solved using IMEX methods, and our perturbation expansion technique (labelled REGIME) solved using standard explicit methods.

							Here we show an example of magnetic reconnection, for two different resistivities, quite a long way from the ideal limit. If ideal MHD were used then the "islands" of magnetic pressure should stay separate. By including resistivity magnetic reconnection causes them to interact, with the width of the boundary layer linked to the resistivity value. The results here show the Chapman-Enskog approach is visually indistinguishable from the full resistive values. We also see clean convergence with grid resolution and with conductivity.

							To get more insight into what this approach is doing, and to link back to our binary neutron star motivation, we look at a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. There's the standard Kolmogorov cascade of energy from large scales down to small, which is similar for all models. As we get to higher frequencies, and hence smaller scales, we see the different models diverge. Whilst the REGIME model is closer to the resistive case than the ideal is, once we start reaching grid-cell resolutions there is a substantial difference. This suggests that the REGIME model is capturing the large scale features of the resistive model, not the small.

							Finally, we need to check the performance of REGIME against the resistive model. REGIME's performance is pretty much independent of the resistivity. In contrast, the runtime for an explicit RK scheme for the full resistive model (blue curve) blows up well before interesting resistivities are reached. The IMEX schemes allow physical resistivities to be evolved, but are always slower than regime, usually by factors of 5-10 or more.

						<h2>The general case</h2>
						<p>
							GR has source terms. Schematically
							$$
							\begin{aligned}
								\partial_t {\bf q} + \partial_i {\bf f}^{(i)}({\bf q}, \overline{\bf q}) &= {\bf s}({\bf q}, \overline{\bf q}), \\
								\partial_t \overline{\bf q} + \partial_i \overline{\bf f}^{(i)}({\bf q}, \overline{\bf q}) &= \color{red}{\eta^{-1}} \overline{\bf s}({\bf q}, \overline{\bf q}).
							\end{aligned}
							$$
						</p>
						<p>
							Chapman-Enskog expansion still works:
							$$
								\partial_t {\bf q} + \partial_i \left( {\bf f}^{(i)}_0 + \color{green}{\eta} {\bf F}^{(i)} \right) = {\bf s}_0 + \color{green}{\eta} \left( {\bf S} + \partial_i {\bf D}^{(i)} \right).
							$$
						</p>
						<p>
							With ${\bf D}^{(i)} \sim A^{ij} \partial_j {\bf q}$ we still have diffusive correction.
						</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Moving to general relativity, which we need for the neutron star merger, we now have source terms due to the gravitational effects. This makes the expansion process practically more complex, and it appears to be qualitatively different in a range of ways. <br>
						In this more general case we still have a source term correction that is parabolic or diffusive like, in that it contains second derivative terms. This is very similar to the earlier cases. However, we now have corrections to the fluxes and sources. These are all proportional to the resistivity, and it's not transparent as to exactly where the terms should sit. <br>
						In our case, directly evolving the terms here in the "obvious" form leads to accuracy and stability that is very close to the results in special relativity. So whilst this case appears much more complex, the key conceptual questions of accuracy and stability seem to follow the simpler case without change.

						Working together with Bruno Giacomazzo, Alex has repeated the simulation of a magnetized binary neutron star merger shown at the start of the talk. However, he's also added resistivity. Here we're showing the results of the simplest case: the resistivity is constant, and as large as reasonably seems plausible (which is still six orders of magnitude smaller than previous simulations). This gives us the most direct comparison of the effect of resistivity to date. <br>
						Most qualitative features are unchanged by the introduction of resistivity. The clearest difference can be seen by tracking the maximum density in the simulation, which is usually at the core of the stars or the remnant. The first vertical line indicates the point where the stars merge. The dots, associated with the steep drop in density, is when the black hole forms.
						<br>
						We clearly see a delay in the formation of the black hole when resistivity is included. This seemed odd to us: we expected that resistivity would, well, resist the motion, slowing the matter, and reducing the effective pressure support from rotation. So our expectations were that any visible resistive effects would lead to earlier collapse, not later.

						To check that this effect is real and not an artefact of small corrections, Alex went to the most extreme case plausible. The resistivity remains the same, but we remember that resistive effects (such as changes in helicity) are also linked to the magnetic field strength. By increasing the seed magnetic field to magnetar strength, the limit of what might be plausible, we can check the impact of resistivity. <br>
						Now the delay in black hole formation is long enough that the simulation can barely be performed. It's clear that something about resistivity is increasing the effective pressure support.

								<li>
									Resistivity changes the magnetic field structure;
								</li>
								<li>
									Post-merger the field is "turbulent", messy;
								</li>

								<li>

								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						The best idea we have for the cause of delayed collapse is the magnetic field structure. Here we have plots of some magnetic field lines and two constant density surfaces. The ideal case is at the top, resistive at the bottom. We're still trying to find a good quantitative way of analysing the magnetic field structure, so for now we focus on visual analysis of the field lines as shown here, and proxy analysis via the magnetic pressure and an effective rotational pressure, not shown here. <br>
						The key result from the analysis is that resistivity has no noticeable impact on the magnitude of the magnetic fields, but does have an impact on its ordering. This is probably easier to see, although still not easy, by looking at the field line structure in the bottom of both plots. <br>
						The argument that we want to make from this is that the messy, almost turbulent magnetic field structure that occurs during merger, will be simplified by the resistivity. We expect this analytically from helicity arguments, but it appears to be a substantial effect. By making the magnetic field more "structured" the fluid rotates faster, increasing the effective pressure support and delaying collapse.

						The Chapman-Enskog approach has worked extremely well for the neutron star merger application at current resolutions. Looking ahead, however, for different parameter values or different astrophysical setups we may end up at the opposite extreme, where the resistivity is large. In that case the expansion approach is stiff, but the original method of solving the full Maxwell equations is fine. This leads to the question of whether we can build a code that works for "all resistivities". <br>
						This brings in the idea of Adaptive <i>Model</i> Refinement. As with nearly everything I do, this is not an original idea: it's something I learned of from a throwaway remark in a talk by Ann Almgren, which a previous PGR at Southampton, Alice Harpole, worked on at length when studying nuclear burning on the surface of a neutron star. What we're thinking here is to do spacetime adaptation, as in AMR, of the <i>model</i>, particularly in the equations of motion considered. <br>
						In Alex's first approach we're doing the simplest thing: solving both model approaches to resistive MHD everywhere, and taking a linear combination of the two based on the resistivity. We're always going to use explicit methods, so solving the full Maxwell equations only works for large resistivities, but is always the "real" model, whilst for very small resistivities only the Chapman-Enskog expansion will be stable. By making a multi-material analogy it's easy to see how performance could be further improved. <br>
						The key result can already be seen with a simple shock tube test. In this case we've moved away from using a constant resistivity: instead the resistivity is linked to the density (which is physical) in such a way that it varies over 100 orders of magnitude (which isn't physical, but is a stringent test). This hybrid, adaptive algorithm is completely explicit and totally stable for this problem. Checking the performance we see that at worst it's a factor of a couple compared to any given algorithm at any resistivity, but is the only algorithm that is useable at all resistivities. <br>
						Alex has performed similar tests using related hybrid algorithms on the full neutron star merger problem. In that case the performance benefits are currently small, as the physics doesn't cover a wide range of resistivities (we believe), but it can be used to minimise the small performance gap to ideal MHD simulations.
