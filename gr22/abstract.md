# Relativistic soundproof models

Ian Hawke (presenting), Alice Harpole

Many astrophysical scenarios are described by models with a large range of characteristic speeds. When the most interesting behaviour is dominated by slow (eg advective) effects, accounting for everything can be a problem for numerical simulations, significantly increasing errors and run times. However, exploiting the multiscale nature of the models (through soundproof models such as the Low Mach approximation) can filter out the fastest behaviour, leading to qualitative improvements in accuracy and efficiency. We will present methods and numerical results for soundproof models in strongly relativistic rotating spacetimes, aimed at modelling burning on neutron stars.

# Uncertainty quantification for astrophysical simulations

Ian Hawke

Numerical simulations are required for astrophysical problems where energy cascades to ever-smaller scales, such as neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae. Recent results from the field of uncertainty quantification suggest that these simulations may converge *only* in a statistical sense. We will show examples where, when using standard models, astrophysically useful observables can only be predicted pointwise in a statistical sense, and discuss the restrictions this places on numerical simulation for parameter estimation in neutron star mergers.
